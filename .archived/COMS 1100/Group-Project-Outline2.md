   2. Thesis
      1. Our area of study, media and film, focused on how visual storytelling reflects and shapes culture. By examining cultural appropriation within this field, we can understand how media shapes cultural perception, and influences the way audiences value different groups.

   4. Preview of Main Points
      1. Bring It On
         1. Demonstrates in-movie how cultural appropriation can hinder the visibility of minoritized communities, and take away the sanctity of cultural expression.
      2. Aladdin
         1. Demonstrates how mixing and hodge-podging cultural elements can erase the cultural source.
      3. Pocahontas
         1. Demonstrates how stories and characters can be flattened or simplified by removing or replacing cultural elements.
      4. "My Band" by D12
         1. Demonstrates in both an in-media and out-of-media way that culture can be exploited for popularity.
      5. Peter Pan
         1. Demonstrates the negative of impact of racial stereotyping.
2. Body
   1. Bring It On
      1. Bring It On, made in 2000, follows a white, suburban cheer team called the Toros, who discover their routines were stolen from a predominantly Black and Latino team named the Clovers. The Toros’ success highlights how white institutions often profit from Black creativity a clear example of cultural appropriation in media.
      2. The film also shows mockery through performance. The Toros repeat the Clovers’ hip hop inspired routine without prior permission or credit, receiving praise and trophies for work that isn’t theirs. This turns cultural expression into entertainment.
      3. Visually, the Clovers’ routines are full of energy, rhythm, and cultural identity, while the Toros represent a washed-down version designed to appeal to their majority white audience.
      4. When the Toros’ captain offers the Clovers money to compete at Nationals, it highlights her white privilege  assuming money can fix inequality.
      5. Finally, the film’s power dynamic highlights the Toros as “respectable” leaders, while the Clovers are stereotyped as “ghetto” or “rough,” reflecting how race and class shape who is seen as credible or deserving of recognition.
   2. Aladdin (1992)
      1. The fictionalized, stereotyped setting (“Agrabah”)
         1. Agrabah is not a real place — it blends South Asian, Arab, and even Orientalist architectural and cultural elements into a vague “Middle Eastern” fantasy.
         2. This mixing erases real cultural distinctions and turns diverse Middle Eastern and South Asian traditions into an exotic backdrop designed for Western audiences.
      2. The opening song lyrics (“Arabian Nights”)
         1. The original 1992 version of the song included the lyric: “Where they cut off your ear if they don’t like your face — it’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home!”
         2. This line reinforced racist stereotypes of Arabs and Middle Eastern cultures as violent and “barbaric.” It was later changed after public outcry.
      3. Character designs and colorism
         1. The “good” characters like Aladdin and Jasmine have lighter skin and more Eurocentric facial features, while villains such as Jafar and guards are darker-skinned and more exaggerated in appearance.
         2. This reflects harmful Orientalist coding that associates moral virtue with whiteness and evil with darker features.
      4. The use of generic “exotic” music and imagery
         1. The soundtrack uses stereotypical “Middle Eastern” scales and instruments, flattening complex musical traditions into a Western fantasy sound.
         2. Likewise, costumes, architecture, and decor pull vaguely from Persian, Indian, and Arab influences without cultural accuracy — turning the setting into an aesthetic pastiche.
      5. Voice casting and linguistic mockery
         1. Most of the main characters (including Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Genie) were voiced by white American actors who used Westernized speech patterns, while minor characters often spoke in exaggerated “foreign” accents.
         2. This contrast plays into an old Hollywood trope where “normal” voices belong to heroes and “foreign” ones to villains or comic relief characters.
   3. Aladdin (Live Action 2019)
      1. Ambiguous, invented setting (still “Agrabah”)
         1. The film kept Agrabah as a fictional “Middle Eastern/South Asian hybrid” kingdom, rather than representing any real culture accurately.
         2. The production design blended Indian, Arab, Persian, and even East African aesthetics — turbans, mosques, palaces, markets — in a way that looked “exotic” but lacked authenticity.
         3. Critics argued this continued the Orientalist fantasy of a generalized “Arabian world” made for Western consumption.
      2. Casting controversies and brownwashing
         1. Although the film starred actors of Middle Eastern and South Asian heritage (like Mena Massoud, who is Egyptian-Canadian, and Naomi Scott, who is British-Indian), critics noted the casting of lighter-skinned actors in lead roles.
         2. Disney reportedly even used makeup to darken extras’ skin tones to make the background crowd appear “more Middle Eastern,” which was widely condemned as cultural insensitivity and a form of brownface.
      3. Orientalist costuming and set design
         1. Costume and set designers mixed motifs from various regions — Indian embroidery, Arabian architecture, Persian carpets, North African jewelry — without cultural coherence.
         2. This blending reinforced the idea of the “Orient” as a single, mysterious aesthetic rather than a set of distinct cultures.
      4. The “Prince Ali” scene and exotic spectacle
         1. The parade sequence presents a “caricature of Eastern extravagance” — filled with elephants, genies, dancers, and gold — echoing colonial fantasies of wealth and excess.
         2. Some viewers argued this visual spectacle exoticizes “Eastern” cultures, using them as colorful spectacle rather than as authentic cultural expressions.
      5. Western storytelling lens and modernization choices
         1. Disney marketed the 2019 Aladdin as “modern” by giving Jasmine more agency and a feminist subplot (“Speechless”), but critics noted that this empowerment was framed through Western ideals of feminism.
         2. In doing so, it arguably ignored real Middle Eastern feminist traditions and voices — substituting a Western narrative about “liberating” women from a “repressive culture.”
   4. Pocahontas
      1. Stereotypes about being connected with nature/ magical
         1. Grandmother willow
         2. “Colors of the wind”
         3. Visions in smoke
      2. “Savage” native
         1. “Savages” song
         2. War hungry
      3. Fetishization of native women
         1. Aging up Pocahontas
         2. Forced love story
            1. Based on fictional accounts by John Smith
      4. White washing history
         1. John Smith as a hero
         2. Battle of Jamestown was on both sides
   5. "My Band" by D12
      1. D12 was a detroit rap group featuring Eminem and 5 other members. 
   6. Peter Pan
      1. The boys call them redskins, aborigines, and injuns.
      2. They say “lets capture some indians”
      3. They say “we’re out to fight the injuns”
      4. They see footprints and say blackfoot tribe, algonquin group, a tribe native to the Montana area, so it isn’t made up and they are just using a known tribe. The boys refer to them as “quite savage”
      5. They say “the indian is cunning, but not intelligent”
      6. All the natives have long dark hair covering their eyes with feathers in their hair, comically large noses and brown skin, and they walk hunchbacked. They are also all shirtless.
      7. The natives wear headbands and necklaces and blankets and all play drums.
      8. The chief is very red skinned with a massive headdress of feathers and two horns, earrings, and face paint.

      17. They make fun of how every word sounds the same and means the same thing “hana means what mana means and gana means that too.”
      18. They tell Wendy “Squaw no dance, squaw get em firewood.”
      19. They say that “the red man is red because of when he kissed a maid and he’s been blushing every sense” and then Peter turns red.
      20. Peter and the boys make fun of the Indians by imitating their tribe when they get home.
      21. Wendy says “do you want to stay here and grow up like savages?”
3. Conclusion
    1. Review of Main Points
       1. We discussed how the protagonist school of Bring It On has their ability to express culture taken away.
       2. And then discussed how mixing and mashing together different cultural elements can erase their origin and create people and places like Agrabah
       3. We then talked about in Pocahontas about how the Native Americans were flat 1-dimensional characters without a true cultural origin.
       4. Through D12's "My Band" we saw in both a firsthand way and meta way how culture is and can be exploited fro fame or money.
       5. And then lastly we reviewed Peter Pan's egregious depiction of Native Americans
    2. Restate Thesis
       1. Through the media we've examined, we've reasonably shown the impact cultural appropriation has on both the culture, the consumer of media, and the quality of the media itself.
    3. Closure
