## Notes

### Weeks 12 and 13: Problem Solving and Decision Making

#### Problem State Space

Made up of four components

1. Goals (Final and Intermed)
2. Givens (Set of Constraints)
3. Means of Transforming Conditions (Set of Rules)
4. Obstacles (Unexpected Results for which one may not have Immediate Knowledge of how to proceed)

#### Problem Space and Task Environment (Newell and Simon)

Task Environment
: The actual problem as in the conditions, goals, and transformations

Problem Space
: The problem solver's representation of the problem

#### Types of Problems

Well-defined Problems
: Completely defined initial conditions, goals, and transformations
: Ex. Chess

Ill-defined Problems
: Without clear knowledge of initial conditions, goals, or transformations
: Ex. Completing your B.A. degree fastest

#### Monkey-Banana Problem (Kohler)

Tested problem solving in chimpanzees
Chimp in a room with boxes, a stick, and some hanging bananas
To get the bananas, the chimp has to stack then climb up on the boxes and hit them with the stick

1. Initial Conditions
   1. Stick in cage
   2. Bananas hanging from ceiling
   3. Three boxes labaled A, B, and C
   4. Boxes unstacked
2. Constraints
   1. At least two boxes must be stacked for the chimp to reach the bananas with the stick
   2. Stick is of a certain length
   3. Bananas are hung at a certain height
3. Transformations
   1. Stack two boxes
   2. Pick up the stick
   3. Reach up with the stick

#### Hill Climbing

Hill Climbing
: The problem solving strategy of moving to the next state that minimizes the distance between the state and the final goal
: The strategy of making the most 'optimal' choice

#### Representation

Newell and Simon argued that the difficulty of a problem is tied to how critical features of the task environment has been represented within a problem space

Real-world problem solving is about transforming ill-defined problems into well-defined problems

Representation of a Problem
: The problem states and operators
: Different problem states and operators contain different amounts of information

Human Information Processing System
: Cognitive capacities influences problem solving by setting storage and processing limitations

#### General Problem Solver

Newell and Simon believed their framework for characterizing problem solving served as a general engine for oslving problems of all types

#### Dunker's Experiment (1945)

Show a picture to subjects of the following items:

- Matches
- A box with tacks (too small to go through candle)
- Candle
