# Digital Game Design Concepts (ECT 2401) Notes

## 3-4-24

High Concept
: Top-level pitch for a game, 3-4 sentences, describes story and gameplay, including characters and motivation.

## 3-6-24

Interactive Storytelling
: Players can do something that impacts the story -> Actions have consequences/meaning

Narratology
: The study of narrative

Ludology
: The study of play

Ludologists value play more, Narratologists value story more.

Ludo-narrative dissonance
: When gameplay does not match the narrative or vice-versa

Combinatorial Explosion
: When the number of decisions or plot lines results in an unmanageable state -> Generally results in dropped plot points.

Foldback Scenes
: Scenes that the player will experience regardless of choices AKA the "All Roads lead to Rome".

Granularity
: Slowly giving pieces of plot so that story doesn't explode/unravel immediately.
