# ECT 1700 - Final Project

Panic at the Rave

By Eric Popp and Rev Guarino

## Which form of XR are you using and why is this the perfect medium for your idea?

Our XR experience is a single-player VR game, we chose this form because of the cognitive and sensory budgeting it affords. By being a single-player experience, there is no competition for the player's attention. Similarly, by being in VR we have an isolated auditorial/visual sandbox which both increases the emphasis on our ques in addition to improving the player's ability to interpret and learn from said ques.

### Are you using one of the four types of Fun? Why or why not?

Our game is primarily Type 2 fun, with the player being agent in 'how Type 2' the experience is via different difficulty settings. The difficulty setting more or less correlates to how punished a player is for failing a mechanic, and because the progress on a boss encounter resets on each attempt on all difficulties, it is tied to how close or distant a feeling of achievement is.

## Which of the FIVE Kinds of Audience Members in LEAN FORWARD ENTERTAINMENT do you intend to attract and how are you planning to attract them?

Our game would be most attractive to Achievers but also has appeal for Explorers, Competitors, and Rule Breakers.

### Achievers

The game's draw for Achievers is that it is essentially constructed of back-to-back milestones via the boss encounters, all of which can be completed on varying difficulties.

### Explorers

Because of how tightly the game's mechanics are coupled to the music and visuals, Explorers would be drawn in by a desire to hear each song and/or see each boss fight.

### Competitors

Almost every game within the Souls-like genre includes a portion that want to hit things for the biggest numbers and kill bosses the fastest.

## Explain how the 5E's of Immersive Stroytelling will be addressed in your experience

### Enticing

The biggest draw to the game is that it explores an uncharted territory within its genre through its use of sound. Though not necessarily a rhythm game, having boss mechanics that are sychronized with components of the music is unique in a catalogue of games that typically have immemorable soundtracks.

### Entering

Once you take a step inside Panic at the Rave, there is a sense of mystery both inside and outside the game to draw you in further. You, the player, know the title of the game and have an expectation of vibrant colors and loud music. But the character you've taken the mantle of is a hardboiled detective and sees the world in shades of gray, charcoal, and slate.

### Engaging

As soon as the glasses are introduced to the player, there's a hard tonal pivot that in conjunction with the boss encounters, starts a rollercoaster of feelings. This shift also forces the player into the mental state of the character, all of sudden the world is filled with color and danger. Which then transitions into 'figuring out' mode as they try to learn and defeat bosses, exactly like a detective would.

### Exiting

As the game comes to its conclusion, the tone does another pivot but this time into a bit of melancholy as the tragedy of the final boss is revealed and the player has to accept that the 'ride is over'. Ideally, the player is left with a wanting for more of this experience, a wanting for more color; just like the protagonist.

### Extending

The lasting impact of the game is in its music and the perceptual change it creates. At a baseline, they'll remember the songs and potentially listen to them from time to time, not necessarilly to reminisce about the game but because they have standalone value. Moreover, a player would be hard-pressed to go to a concert or listen to rave/techno/industrial music without remembering the visuals and experience of the game. At a baseline, they'll turn to their concert buddy and say "Wouldn't it be crazy if the singer did [favorite boss mechanic here]".

## Explain how Agency, Story, and/or Fun will be used in your game

### How much Agency does your guest have?

Panic at the Rave uses the Megaman model where players are able to dictate their experience by choosing the order in which they confront different bosses. The player is also able to ignore the story entirely and just enjoy beating down baddies.

### Are you using a Genre? Why or why not?

In terms of gameplay, Panic at the Rave is a Souls-like. The core game loop is

## Explain how you think about Embodiement/Character/Personae

### Are your guests DOG, GOD, BOD, OR GRIFFIN? Themselves, an archetype, a specific other, or a phantasm?

## Explain the fundamental user interface of your XR experience

## Explain how you are using four of the following

### Interaction Design

### Environmental Storytelling

### Memory, Emotion, and Attention

### Visual Spatial vs. Phonological Tasks

## Discuss the use of PRIMARY and SECONDARY emotions in your experience, and use some sort of MAP to explain your design

## Identify and explain the TONE and MOOD of your piece, and use some sort of MAP to explain your design

## Using the languege of the industry, describe FOUR facets of the interior design of your experience. LIGHT must be one of the four facets discussed
