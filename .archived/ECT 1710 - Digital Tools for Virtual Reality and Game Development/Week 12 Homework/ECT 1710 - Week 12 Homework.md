## Project Design Document

### Player Control

You control a [Tank] in this [3rd Person Over the Shoulder] game where [WASD] makes the player [move forward using Tank-drive style controls, ie. A lowers the left side power and D lowers the right side power] and [Spacebar] makes the player [fire their turret.]

### Basic Gameplay

During the game, [Enemy Tanks] appear from [the Map Edge] and the goal of the game is to [survive as long as possible].

### Sound & Effects

There will be sound effects [for your tank engine, enemy tank engines, and when either shoots] and particle effects for [incoming projectiles and hazardous explosions.]

### Gameplay Mechanics

As the game progresses, [the enemy spawn rate increases and the player collects upgrades] making it [increasingly difficult but completeable].

### User Interface

The [radar] will [display markers] whenever [an enemy shoots or is within a certain range of you.] At the start of the game, the title [TankLike] will appear and the game will end when [the player takes 3 hits from enemies.]

### Other Features

There will also be a meta-progression system where you start each run stronger based on how much you've played.
