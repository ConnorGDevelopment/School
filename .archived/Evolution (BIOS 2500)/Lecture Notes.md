## Week 2, Day 1

Science generally made to conform to religion, primarily Christianity.

Carl von Linne - Theologian and Nomenclature

### William Paley - Natural Theology

Watchmaker
If you're walking around a path, see a watch, you pick it up and look at it. If you look inside, you'd see the intricacy and that the removal of any one piece would destroy the movement.
Argued that we have to an intelligent designer, because of the complexity of ecosystems.

### St. Hilaire

Formalist - Archetype and Homology
Basic physical constraints arising out of the fundamental properties of matter.
Archetypes, repeated design in multiple areas.
Homology, similar structures in similar organisms because they developed from the same root.

### George Cuvier

Functionalist - Function and Adaptation
Series of adaptations building on each other
Couldn't make sense of extinction
Series of revolutions, loss of organisms
Tried to argue within the context of theology

### Age of the Earth

Bishop James Ussher, trying to determine how old the Earth is in accordance with bible and observations

### Greeks: Materialist School

Thales of Miletus
First theory of development of life
Arose from undifferentiated, universal substance
Humans from fish, plants from mud

At the end of each cycle leaves fossils
"Ideas can be off, but that's where history starts" - Prof

### Materialists

Buffon's Law
Common ancestry
Organic change, change in species over time
Didn't know the mechanism of how change occurs, but observed it had to exist
Variation is important
Species may be "improved" or "degenerated"
World not 6000 years old instead 75000 years (math null, but imporant because contradicts bible)

James Hutton
Founder of Modern Geology
Erosion, Sedimentation, Uplift
Theory of Uniformitarianism
The world has evolved over time (tectonic evolution and formations)

Charles Lyell
Principles of Geology
Popularized Uniformitarianism
Detailed natural geological processes

Erasmus Darwin (Darwin's Grandfather)
Zoonomia
"would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament"
The Temple of Nature, limerick about evolution

Lanmarck
"First Law" - Use or Disuses
"Second Law" - Heritable Changes, inheritance of acquired characteristics
View of Evolution - Increasing complexity and perfection
First to come up with a mechanism of how animals adapt
Did not believe in extinction

### The Stage before Darwin

The earth is very old
Extinction
Fossils were similar to extant forms

### Charles Darwin

Second-born, no inheritance waiting for him
Had to get a job, father said he would be a doctor
Hated medicine, liked biology
Was a dropout
Father said become a Vicar, sent him to study theology
Met Reverend Henslow, a botanist, natural theologian, encouraged Darwin's interest in nature
Reverend Henslow recommended Darwin be the naturalist for the Beagle, ship of FitzRoy

Transmutation of Species
Notebook B
First phylogenetic tree diagram
Organisms being closely or distantly related

Malthus Notebook D
No checks -> population grows explanation
Formation of the idea of Natural Selection

On the Origin of Species
Alfred Russell Wallace sent Darwin a manuscript detailing Natural Selection, idea was going to scoop idea out from under him
Decided to present jointly with Wallace at the Linnaean Society
Organisms are the products of a history of descent with modification from common ancestors
Principle mechanism of evolution is the natural selection of heritable evolutions
Many Victorians rejected Darwin's work (humans come from apes, even though Darwin didn't say humans)
Scientists quickly accepted the fact of evolution
Natural selection as mechanism was not accepted until the 1930s (coincided with Mendel's study of genetics)

## Week 2, Day 2

**Quiz due by Monday Jan 30th**

**Quiz 2 due by Wednesday Feb 1st**

### Tree Thinking vs. Ladder Thinking

Evolution is non-sequential
Gradual change vs. Speciation
Not all branches get to the top, extinction cuts short or terminates a branch

Cladogenesis, where one lineage separates into two
Anagenesis, gradually change over time

Phylogenetic Tree
Phylogeny: a diagram depicting the evolutionary relationships among a group of organisms
Interbreeding across generations
Tree is actually a collection of data points representing populations
Tips of tree are taxons
Internodes, the 'length' or 'bar' of a branch
Look for common ancestors
Monophyletic group = clade

Polytomy is a node that is represented by two or more branches
Fishes are paraphyletic
Reptiles are paraphyletic if you do not group birds with reptiles

The Problem with Paraphyly
Classification of higher taxa should be based on common descent (monophyletic groups)

Paraphyly misleads regarding relationships
    Did you know birds are reptiles, did you know that you are a fish?

Why paraphyly perists?
    Adapative zones vs. Clades
    Tradition

Sister Taxa, adjacent branches
Sister Clades, adjacent clades
Outgroup, the 'anchor' for a tree, connects to the 'master' tree

Traditional Linnaean Classification
Class -> Order

Rank Free (Phylogenetic) Classification
Tetrapoda -> Amniota -> Reptilia -> etc

Homoplasy, similar traits but due to environments instead of relationships
Ex. Porcupines, Hedgehog, Lesser Hedgehog Tenrec

Convergent Evolution: Similarity between species that is caused by a similar, but evolutionarily independent, response to an environment
Bones = Homologous
Wings = Analagous

## Week 3, Day 1

Start of Universe
Big Bang 13.8 byr ago
Earth forms 4.5 byr ago
Earth formed by the collision and coalescence of solar debris after the formation of the sun
Radiometric dating of meteorites ~4.5 byr
Radiometric dating, looking at radio-isotopes in rocks

No rocks survive from when the earth formed
500 myr needed for earth to cool
Oldest minerals 4.4 byr old (Zircon Australia)
Oldest rocks 4 byr
Heavy Bombardment: Comets & Asteroids peppered all the planets in solar system (inc Earth) from 4.1-3.8 byr
Early atmosphere toxic - no O2

Formation of the moon 4.53 bya
Theia merged with the earth, adding to size of Earth
The material that splashed off of Earth at impact and coalesced into the moon
The collision tilted the Earth's orbital plane 23 degrees. -> caused seasons
If a collision like this happened today, all the oceans on Earth would instantly evaporate

The early forms of life went extinct long, long ago
Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) - thing that resembles a cell
Primordial form - first living thing

Stromatolites

Laters are produced as calcium carbonate and sediment precipitate over a growing mat of cyanobacteria -> fossil left by bacteria

Evidence of photosynthesis from C isotope ratios
12-CO2 is used in photosyntehsis over 13 CO2
Organic matter from photosynthesis has a different ratio of 12C:13C
Can be used to look for chemical evidence of early life

Where did oxygen produced during this time go?
Earth's atmosphere did not become enriched in Oxygen until 2 bya
Reduced Iron acted as an "oxygen sink" -> signature of banded ironstone
Iron had to oxidize before Oxygen could collect -> estimated 1.8-2.2 bya

Extraterrestial Theory
Panspermia -> transferral of viable organisms between planets seeded life on Earth

Could early life survive space travel?
Apollo 12 recovered Strep from camera left by Surveyor III
Rock from Mars -> organic molecules present (formed by life?)
Mars cooled faster than the Earth -> habitable sooner

Oparin-Haldane Theory
Inorganic Molecules -> Organic Molecules -> Biological Polymers -> Replicating Systems -> Protocells -> True Cells
Chemical Soup -> Life
Evidence: Stanley Miller and Harold Urey Experiment
Proteinoids -> Protein Microspheres

Theories are generally exclusive

Replication
DNA -> Protein -> DNA
DNA -> RNA -> Protein

RNA: Ribonucleic Acid, stores information, performs cellular functions

These can't individually replicate and build
Chicken and Egg scenario

RNA World
1982: Discovery that RNA possesses catalytic activity (speeds up the rate of chemical reactions without itself being consumed)
Phenotype: Catalytic Activity
Genotype: Sequence of Bases similar to DNA
Such RNA molecules that possess catalytic activity are called Ribozymes

Clues for RNA World
Over two dozen ribozymes have been characterized -> All catalyze the formation or cleavage of phosphodiester bonds found in RNA and DNA
RNA is everywhere in the basic process of cells -> Protein synthesis, ATP, similar to DNA
In labs, catalytic ability of ribozymes has been evolved using artifical selection experiments

What is Life?
"Life began the moment molecules of information started to reproduce and evolve by natural selection"
Old traits assigned to LUCA -> Movement, Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion, Nutrition

## Week 3, Day 2

Fossils originally thought of as supernatural to fit Bible
Thomas Jefferson told the Lewis and Clark expedition to keep their eyes open for mastodons, dinosaurs, and other creatures

### Fossilization: the variety of processes that enables the preservation of organic remain within the geological record

Requires:
Rapid & permanent burial/entombment -> protected specimen
Oxygen deprivation
Sediment accumulation -> maintain burial
Absence of excessive heat or compression

### Permineralized Fossils

Organism buried in sediment
Typical replacement of minerals

Unaltered remains
Highly acidic environment that prevent rotting
Ice age permafrost
Insects in amber

Fossils are remains of organisms and their products that actually existed
Excellent fossil records exist for some groups
Fossil record is good, millions have been found

Geologic Time Scale
Originally based on sediment but nowadays we use radio-isotopes

### Proterozoic Eon

2.5 bya to 542 mya
Prokaryotes continue to dominate as we move into the Proterozoic
Stromatolites that appear in the Archean reach their greatest abundance 1.2 bya
Accumulation of oxygen in atmosphere
Emergence of Eukaryotic cells and multicellular organisms -> 1.6 to 2.1 bya
"Aerobic respiration is more energy efficient than anaerobic respiration"

### Precambrian

Oldest animal fossils -> Sponges
650 mya: Fossils sponges
635 mya: Evidence of cholesterol-like molecules made by only one group of sponges

### Ediacaran Biota

The first metazoans appear
Difficult to identify
Cholesterol found in every animal, not plants
Ikaria Wariootia -> Explained burrow in sediments, they had symmetry (hallmark of animals), evidence for multicellular bilateral organisms
Limited morphological diversity
Limited ecological diversity
Bilateral symmetry rare, but present
Mostly soft

### Cambrian Explosion

Most of the larger groups we recognize today appear suddenly
Body parts: segmentation, limbs, hard shells, antennae, internal/external skeletons
Movement: swim, crawl, float, burrow, walk, sit
Diet: detritivores, scavengers, predators, grazers, filter feeders

#### Burgess Shale (BC Canada)

Very well preserved animals, 505-515 mya
Muddy sea floor beneath a high reef wall of algae
Mud slides occasionally washed in organisms into deeper water lacking oxygen

#### Chengjiang Biota

525-520 mya
Very well preserved organisms also, but older

### What caused the Cambrian Explosion

A sudden increase in atmospheric O2 due to photosynthesis by bacteria and algae
Higher O2 allowed for higher metabolism and much larger body sizes
Origin of hard parts, co-evolutionary dynamics drove the evolution of complexity in body plans
Extinction: Mass extinction event followed by Adaptive Radiation
Adaptive Radiation typically follows extinction, opens door for ecological niches

## Week 4, Day 1

**Always include reproduction when describing Natural Selection** -> Have to show mechanism
Natural Selection doesn't care about species -> it acts on **individuals** in a population -> Avoid talking about 'for the benefit of the species'
Avoid words like progressive, implies goal at the end of evolution
Darwin didn't say "Survival of the Fittest"

**Exam next week! Book now!**
Covers material from beginning to 2/8/23
Need to know the specific examples from the book:
  Tiktaalik
  Be familiar with whale evolution
  Theropods
  Need to know individuals and contributions -> Dates not important **EXCEPT** for Darwin
Read Prof's notes!
Questions come directly from Lecture slides
Most questions will be 1-3 sentence
If worth 1 point, single word or sentence

Homology
Before Darwin, homology referred to structural similarity between species, even when the structures differed wildly in function
'Darwin' Homology = Similarity between species that is a result of inheritance of traits from a common ancestor
Analogy = Similarity due to convergent evolution, not shared ancestry. False homology, also called homoplasy. Homology not from similar ancestor but from similar environments -> Dolphins and Fish both have fins but for different reasons

Bones = Homology
Wings = Analogy

Pterosaur vs Bat vs Bird
Your Inner Fish - Book/PBS Footage

Transitional Form: A species that exhibits traits common to ancestral and derived groups, especially when the groups are sharply differentiated

Because life is branching, species aren't sequential, re: the monkey following man drawing
Fossils are rarely if ever direct ancestors
Best to assume all fossils are on a terminal branch instead of a node or internode

Vestigial Traits
Gradual reduction of the pelvis in whale evolution
Imply descent from a common ancestor
Ex. Flightless birds
Snakes: Tiny remnant hind limbs ('anal spurs') in pythons

Atavism
Ex. Dolphin with hind limbs
Tells us that the genes necessary to present these features are still present
Normally these genes are 'turned off'

## Week 4, Day 2

Didn't take notes :(

## Week 5, Day 1

Whale -> Ear bone is the special thing

Darwin + Wallace -> Special because it dismissed species 'actually existing'.

## Week 5, Day 2

World divided into regions based on species familiarity

Nearctic, Paleartic, Ethiopian, Oriental, Australian, Neotropical

Wallace's Line -> Very different groups of animals between Australia to Lombok and Bali to mainland Asia

Ecological characteristics limits a species geographical distribution

Ecological Niches

Species give rise to descendants that live in the same region
Because species give rise to descendants that live in the same region, similarities are often due to convergent evolution
Smilodon vs Thylacosmilus
Placental vs Marsupial equivalencies

Extinction between migration in landbridge, impacted distribution with hellbender

Range Expansion, artifical or habitat change causes increases or decreases over time
Shakespeare Society Starling
Range Expansion can leave behind relict populations

Remote islands typically only have species that are capable of long distance dispersal
Amphibians can't do saltwater

Most island species are descended from nearby mainland species

The proportion of endemic species on islands is highest when the opportunity for dispersal to the island is low -> More when far, less when close

Island species have traits from continental ancestry
Hooks on seeds on islands w/o mammals

**Oceanic Islands**: Islands that were never attached to a continent

Giantism common on islands

Lineage recency proportional to island age with volcanic islands

Vicariance is the separation of a continuously distributed ancestral species or group of species into separate parts due to the development of geographical or ecological barriers

## Week 7, Day 1?

### Natural Selection

Individuals vary in phenotype
Some of this variation can be inherited
This variation can affect offspring's survival and breeding chance

1. Traits under selection only impact chance of survival and reproduction
2. Selection operates directly on phenotypes of individuals, but populations evolve across generations
3. Selection can operate even if the characters under selection are not heritable -> does not cause evolution
4. Natural Selection is a process that is testable

#### Struggle for Existence

No species reproduces to the maximum extent possible
Not all individuals survive to reproduce or reproduce maximally

No woman starts having children as soon as possible and have a child every 9 months

## Week 7, Day 2?

### Adaptation

Different than acclimation

Behaviors that aid in survival

Flys with the threat display of Jumping Spiders

Snakes hiding under rocks to cool off

### Snake Study

1. Measured thermal performance in the lab
2. Documentation of availability of options
3. Documentation of field temperatures

The fitness consequences of optimizing thermal performance were not addressed. There may be trade-offs like exposure to predators. Did not examine if this increased reproduction.

Exaptation: Adaptations that get repurposed

Keas switching from typical bird diet to feeding Sheep

Not all traits are adaptations -> Human chins are a byproduct of having two jawbones coming together, the chin has to exist

## Lecture 17

Cooperation/Mutualism: Actor Benefits, Recipient Benefits
Altruism: Actor Harmed, Recipient Benefits
Selfishness: Actior Benefits, Recipient Harmed
Spite: Actior Harmed, Recipient Harmed

### Fitness

Direct Fitness = Personal Reproduction
Indirect Fitness = The additional reproduction by relatives that is made possible by an indvidual's actions
Inclusive Fitness = Direct Fitness + Indirect Fitness
Kin Selection = Natural selection favoring the spread of alleles that increase indirect fitness

### Inclusive Fitness

r = relatedness
B = the benefit to the recipient
C = cost to the actor

**Hamilton's Rule**: Br > C
If the benefit multiplied by relatedness outweighs the cost, an allele will spread
