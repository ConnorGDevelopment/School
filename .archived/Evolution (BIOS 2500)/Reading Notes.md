## Chapter 3 - Remnants: Vestiges, Embryos, and Bad Design

### Intro

Atavisms - Reawakened ancestral genes
Palimpsests - overwritten parchment

### Vestiges

Ostriches use wings to balance, threaten, and shade young
Ostrich wings are vestigial traits
"Vestigial trait: a feature of a species that was an adaptation in its ancestors"
Sometimes vestigial traits have new functions, sometimes they do become more or less obsolete
Most flightless birds evolved on islands with few mammals and reptiles
Flight is metabolically expensive, if you don't need it, it's better to not have it
    More energy efficient, easier to have smaller wings on ground, safer due to smaller apendage size
Similar story with ground / cave dwellers and eyes
Whales have vestigial pelvis and leg bones -> not even attached to the rest of their bones
Humans have the appendix (caecum), in grazers it is used to digest fibrous foods
Coccyx is vestigial tale, muscles still attach but bone fusion prevents movement
Arrector pili, tiny muscles that make hair stand on end, are features from when we were apes and would spike our hair up out of aggression or for warmth
The ability to wiggle ears is from remnant muscles that were used to rotate ears
Sometimes features can't 'disappear', the appendix though less than useful might become harmful if shrunk further or all together absent

### Atavisms

"Atavisms, from the Latin atavus, or 'ancestor'"
Atavisms aren't necessarily mutations, they are reawakening or expression of genes used by ancestor
Some whales have rear leg
Horses develop with three toes but the middle one becomes larger and the other two become "splint bones" -> The splints
Vestigial tails are atavisms
Hen's Teeth - 1980 by EJ Kollar and C Fisher -> Grafting of chicken embryo on top of tissue from jaw of developing mouse

## Chapter 4 - The Geography of Life

### Intro - Juan Fernandez Islands

Juan Fernandez Islands -> Collection of artifically planted species found ashore
**Endemic**: Found nowhere else in the world
No amphibians, reptiles, or mammals on the islands

Darwin posited that evolution was the cause for weird distributions among the world
Why does Australia have marsupials when the world has placental mammals?
**Biogeography**: The study of the distribution of species

Darwin found seashells high in the Andes, proving that the world had changed significantly over time
Species spread and then evolve separately + continental drift and molecular taxonomy
DNA sequences change at a 'rate' -> molecular clock

### Continents

Similar biomes can produce similar species, but they are still different
The Americas have cacti while Africa have euphorbs, watery clear sap vs milky bitter sap
Australia planted prickly pear, it became invasive, became controlled in 1926 via Cactoblastis Moths
More complex than "this slight variation is more advantageous to the environment" because the species can exist in the environments of each other
**Convergent Evolution**: Species developing similar traits
