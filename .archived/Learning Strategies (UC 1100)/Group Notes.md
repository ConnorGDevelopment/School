# Patterns in Learning

## Background Information

Humans look for patterns in the world because our brain inherently remembers information that follows a pattern better than information that does not. (Source Needed)

Your brain remembers in chunks, the less chunks there are, the easier it is to rememeber. (Can be omitted, says same thing as first sentence but more layman)

We receive a lot of information unchunked or chunked in a way that isn't optimized for how you as an individual and how you are going to use that information. (Sentence to relate to audience)

For instance, history textbooks are usually written chronologically. But if you're writing a paper about how different events contributed to the start of WWII, it would be more useful to have that information drawn out in a flowchart. (Example of using a pattern)

## Passive Knowledge Benefits

Why develop pattern recognition? Being better at recognizing patterns will help you *passively* remember information.

This is similar to how knowing about logical fallacies can help you *passively* notice bias or how knowing about different personality types can help you *passively* understand people better. (1-2 Examples Here, ideally we grab sources to support them)

## Active Use Benefits

When taking notes, organizing the information into patterns can help you retain information better without requiring extra effort. (Point here about how this doesn't need to be an extra step, just doing it as you take notes the first time can help)
