# Historia Regum Lectus - Our Sexualization of the Medieval Era

The most distinct change in my perspective of the Medieval Era as a result of this course is my newfound awareness of how Medievalism has over-sexualized this period of time. My curiosity was initially peaked after watching the lecture "Dr. Hurley Talks Beowulf Movies" during which she describes how Beowulf has frequently been given a love interest to "inscribe him into a more hetero-normative world" and how doing so is incredibly dismissive of several root elements of the character. The article "Beowulf on Film" by Murray Dahm echoes a similar sentiment but also discusses how no Beowulf adaptations were made or popularized during multiple periods of time where many of its sibling epics, most notably "The Odyssey", were being turned into movies.

This made me start to consider how my own perspective, my only exposure being the 2007 movie by Robert Zemeckis, of Beowulf was wrong and how many other people might also only know this 'False Beowulf'. Being a programmer with a need to understand the world through data, I made a list combining all the adaptations mentioned in the Week 1 Course Content.

Beowulf Adaptations (Non-Exhaustive):
Beowulf (2007) - Robert Zemeckis
Heroes & Demons - Star Trek Voyager
Grendel - BYU Student Film
The Mere Wife - Maria Dahvana Headley
Eaters of the Dead - John Crichton
Grendel - John Gardner
Grendel, Grendel, Grendel - Alexander Stitt
Unnamed Opera - Elliot Goldenthal
Four Episodes in Xena: Warrior Princess
The 13th Warrior - John McTiernan
Beowulf & Grendel - Sturla Gunnarsson

If you take this list and sort it by notoriety, the 2007 movie would most likely take the #1 seat. However, in a very un-statistically significant way, you likely get the same result if you sort this list by sexual content. That isn't massively significant to the discussion about Beowulf, but I think it's very significant to the discussion of Medievalism.

The idea of the Medieval Era being over-sexualized didn't occupy as much of my mind as it does now until the second week when we covered the first two episodes of Game of Thrones. My first thought after watching Game of Thrones was that the show "graphically displayed the full spectrum of sexual violence". Through the relationships of the Lannisters and Targaryens, the show promotes the perception that incestuous relationships and royalty were synonymous terms. And it isn't the first to do so, my personal reference being the show the Tudors which was featured a sex to plot ratio similar to Game of Thrones. As discussed in Dr. Wessell Lightfoot's Lecture, the conception of the 'globally domestic women' is a modern concoction and in reality women were the other half of the world and weren't commoditized as they are often presented.

In research for this paper, I went through the top 100 'Medieval' shows listed on IMDB (<https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=tv_series&keywords=medieval-times>) and of the live-action movies and shows listed (this excludes animated and comedic entries) a staggering 84% explicitly and repeatedly featured sex. Also notably, this trend does not exist in other genres even in drama and romance. I think the reason behind this is the intersection of Hollywood "Sex Sells" mentality and chivalry. In Chapter 5 of the Devil's Historian, Kaufman describes how the idea of Chivalry is perpetuated in the modern world with sources ranging from hyper-religious evangelists to extremists groups like the Nazis. I think the presence of this in our zeitgeist has created a natural push towards plot lines where "The Hero gets the Girl" or maybe more aptly "The Male is rewarded with Women".

There is some evidence of this in the movie El Cid. After watching it, I had trouble deciphering whether or not Jimena was being painted as damsel in distress or if the movie as a whole was trying to be adjacent to Spanish soap operas. As a result of this course, I now realize that there is not a clear answer there because one is inherently constructed from the other.
