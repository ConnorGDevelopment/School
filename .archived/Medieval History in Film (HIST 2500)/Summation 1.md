## Lecture: Starting in the Middle

As stated in Lecture One, the term "Medieval Age" comes from the latin phrase "Medium Aevum" which was coined by Leonardo Bruni. Leonardo Bruni created this term to refer to period of time between his present time and the Classical Era of the Greeks and Romans. Modern Historians define the Medieval Age as being the span of time between 500 AD and 1500 AD and divide it into three parts: the Early Middle Age (500 AD - 1000 AD), the High Middle Age (1000 AD - 1300 AD), and the Late Middle Age (1300 AD - 1500 AD). The term Medievalism refers to the zeitgeist or aesthetic we have created surrounding the Middle Ages, and does not represent the accurate or factual portrayal of any period of time; and in many cases the ideas within it may be full fictional.

## The Devil's Historians pp. 1-28

Augustus Caesar attempted to redefine Roman familial life with a series of laws that were intended to impose restrictions on the rights of women and gave preferential treatment towards citizens and families that fit his ideal patriarchal image. To justify these reforms, he popularized biased perceptions of historical events and created a notion of a more eutopic period of Rome, one that never actually existed as he described.

This example is described in Devil's Historian to illustrate how the misrepresentation of history and the alteration of our perception of history can be powerful tools for oppression and prejudice. The author then goes on to describe how our image of the Medieval Age is ripe with inaccuracy and that it was not a time when unintelligent masses simply lived in fetid squalor hanging friends and family for heresy. In reality, people were as educated as they could be without widespread printing technology, were as healthy as they could be without utilized penicillin, and enacted as many cruel punishments for those deemed deviant or criminal as we do now.

## Lecture: Dr. Hurley Talks Beowulf Movies

During Hurley's talk, she touches on her introduction to Medieval Literature and how surprisingly relevant she found it to her modern life. It is often forgotten that putting the word 'Medieval' in front of the word 'Literature' does not suddenly change the species of the authors from humans to a fictional one that did not experience social issues like gender, sexuality, racism, etc. Medieval Literature comes from people who lived life just as we do, with the exception that they drew more pictures in the margins.

Hurley goes on to talk about the idea that the Medieval Age was a war-torn era where a singular white culture existed in isolation from the rest of the world. She then expands on this and explains how this perception has been created and used to promote racist ideologies and agendas, that all parts of the world existed and experienced the Medieval Ages together.

On the topic of Beowulf, she points out that it is essential to Beowulf's character that he does not have a love interest. Yet, in every adaptation of Beowulf, there is a love interest constructed to present him as both a heterosexual and non-isolated.

## Dahm, Beowulf on Film

Dahm discusses how Beowulf, a poem from the Medieval Age, has either directly or indirectly been at the core of a variety of movies. The skeleton of the story is that a mighty hero slays a terrifying beast, is held in glory in their home, and some time after must return to slay the progeny of that beast whom they are mortally wounded by. Expanding the template of this story, there have also been many films that toe into humanizing a strange monster belonging to the 'other'. As a core component of Grendel, the beast from the original epic, was seeking revenge for their slain mother; a motivation comparable to Beowulf's motivation for slaying their mother.

## The 13th Warrior

The film The 13th Warrior is a fictionalized account of historical figure Ahmad ibn Fadlan's journey to meet Vikings as part of his work as a diplomat. Contrary to the historical account, the movie establishes his assignment as diplomat as being a punishment for having an affair with the wife of a noble. Though fabricated, this is a pseudo-accurate punishment for this crime by 10th Century Islamic standards. An unmarried man committing adultery would have been sentenced with 100 lashes and exile, though being granted a position such as diplomat would be unlikely.

Upon meeting the Vikings, he is quickly enlisted by a seer to be the 13th warrior sent to aid another King in defending his land from a mysterious and fabled threat. Leading up to the direct conflict, the movie follows the plot of a typical "New Kid in School" story where Ahmad's culture, worship of Islam, and language come into conflict with 'brutish' pagan Vikings. But by the time of the main conflict, they begin to develop kinship and see the similarities in their cultures.

The threat, initially thought to be mythical in origin, is revealed to be a cannibalistic tribe. And after an initial raid, the protagonists lead an assault on their home and slay their matriarch, echoing the murder of Grendel in Beowulf. This culminates in a retaliatory attack by the tribe where the leader of the Vikings, previously wounded with an infected blade by the matriarch, defeats their warleader and succumbs to his injuries; in true Beowulf fashion. Ahmad then returns home and in the final scene issues a prayer, asking for blessings upon the pagan Vikings because despite their differing faith, helped him become truer to his own faith.

## Medievalism in Medieval Movie Trailers

The first movie trailer in the series presented, illustrated for me the implicit Christian undertones that make up a portion of Medievalism. Love stories are typically oriented around ideas of purity and the trailer itself used images of stained glass art as found in many churches.

The trailer for Army of Darkness presented Medievalism via a world of knights in armor, magic and witches, and I think most notably an 'Old English' vernacular.

The Name of the Rose trailer depicted a variety of monastic men clad in dreary robes and brutal punishments. It also plays to the idea that the general public pins the unknown on heresy and/or witchcraft.

The fourth trailer and first of the three Robin Hood trailers most notably for me, presented the Medieval world as being full of vibrant, colorful outfits. Though it served well as a means to denote allegiances much like "Black Hats" in Western films, it isn't necessarily historically accurate.

The next Robin Hood trailer showed a typical trope of Medievalism where all forms and agents of government acted in Nero-esque self-interest. I found this notable because the portrayal of government in film in practice would cause societal collapse, though there have been standout examples of tyrants, there had to be some degree of fairness and order simply for society to function and continue to the present-day.
