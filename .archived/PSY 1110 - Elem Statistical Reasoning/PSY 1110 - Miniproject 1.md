# PSY 1110 - Miniproject 1

By Connor Guarino

The article I've chosen to review is titled "[Growing public concern about the role of artifical intelligence in daily life](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/28/growing-public-concern-about-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-daily-life/)" by Alec Tyson and Emma Kikuchi, published by the Pew Research Center.

## 1. Source of research and funding

The article for the most part discusses research conducted by the Pew Research Center themselves, and though it isn't readily available within the article, their website has a section dedicated to describing their funding with public records in association with their 501c status.

## 2. Researchers who had contact with participants

The article provides a link to a document that summarizes the methodology in the study. Participants were emailed a digital questionnaire, so researcher-interaction-based data skew would be minimal.

## 3. Individuals or objects studied and how they were selected

In addition, the methodology summary document includes a description of how they recruited participants. Recruiting was done via phone calls to randomly chosen U.S. phone numbers in English and Spanish. Though it does not describe, at least not in the methodology summary document, what type of 'random' they used. So potentially, they could have regional biases in their data due to clustering.

## 4. Exact nature of the measurements made or questions asked

The article also provides another informational document that includes the questions asked to participants. Though it does not include a screenshot or graphic showing the actual questionnaire. I think displaying this is actually pretty important, because the aesthetics of the questionnaire could easily skew the results; a nice form trends positive impressions, an ugly form trends negative impressions.

## 5. Setting in which measurements were taken

Due to the surveys being conducted digitally, the article doesn't provide information on the environment in which the participants completed the survey. Though they do describe the ways in which they contacted, reminded, and rewarded participants.

## 6. Extraneous differences between groups being compared

The article does a good job covering this element. When they describe the resultant impressions gathered from the study, they make sure to describe the demographics of the participants being referenced with multiple lenses.

## 7. Magnitude of any claimed effects or differences

The study makes reasonable claims about the impressions of Americans. However, there is potentially some population bias inherent to it. The study was completed digitally, meaning the data collected only encompasses people with sufficient tech literacy to complete a digital form. But it could also be said that the 'American' demographic already excludes individuals that are 'offline'.
