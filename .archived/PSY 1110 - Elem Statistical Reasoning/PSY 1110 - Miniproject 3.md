### Does the message of interest stand out clearly?

Yes, the topic is pretty straightforward.

### Is the purpose or title of the picture evident?

Somewhat, the graph is explicitly named and labeled but loses a lot of value outside of the article. You couldn't really gather much information given it alone.

### Is a source given for the data, in picture or article?

Yes, the data is explained in the article and the actual values are provided digitally in bottom right.

### Did the information in the picture come from a reliable source?

Yes, it shows the source in a caption very visibly.

### Is everything clearly labeled, leaving no ambiguity?

Kind of, everything is labeled clearly but the lines and colors are strange. One line represents Weekdays while another is Sundays, it's just a strange way to show that information. Also it fails ADA contrast standards.

### Do the axes start at zero or not?

Yes, they do.

### Do the axes maintain a constant scale?

Yes, they do.

### Are there any breaks in the numbers on the axes that may be easy to miss?

The lines for the estimated values start on the far right, representing projected values, and I didn't spot them until I looked at the legend.

### Is there information cluttering the picture or misleading the eye?

No, not really. The caption is pretty large though, but it is faded so it isn't pulling too much away. I think the main problem is the chart is bland aesthetically to a degree where it impacts the reception of the article. It could have had markers for significant events affecting circulation or highlighted sections representing major changes.

### Does the message of interest stand out clearly?

Yes, it quickly relays its information and makes major changes noticeable.

### Is the purpose or title of the picture evident?

Yes, it provides the information specific to the game and provides context by showing the ranking among other games and the percentile.

### Is a source given for the data, in picture or article?

Not clearly, the page provides links to events and posts from the game's creators but doesn't really show how or where they pulled the data.

### Did the information in the picture come from a reliable source?

More or less, I believe you could recreate the graph by compiling tournament results and viewership records.

### Is everything clearly labeled, leaving no ambiguity?

The axes are not really labeled but all other information is.

### Do the axes start at zero or not?

I assume yes, but it doesn't actually say.

### Do the axes maintain a constant scale?

I believe so but am unsure because of the missing axis labels.

### Are there any breaks in the numbers on the axes that may be easy to miss?

Without axis labels, you have to assume that the distances between values are relatively scaled.

### For financial data, have the numbers been adjusted for inflation?

Unsure, that isn't provided.

### Is there information cluttering the picture or misleading the eye?

No, the site does a good job of keeping things sectioned and concise.
