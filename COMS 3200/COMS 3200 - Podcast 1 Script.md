Grace: “All of us are majoring in fields where we interact with and talk about media, therefore discussing new and developing media and how it is being used is extremely fascinating to us - therefore, today we are going to be talking about a topic we’ve seen emerging within this field.”

## Introduction to series

- What is this going to be about? (Broad topic idea)
  - Grace - So - this is the first episode of a two-part series where we will talk about a new term that is applied to the overall concept of media consumption. This concept has been one that has been developing for quite some time, and the term we will be talking about specifically is “brain rot.”
  - Grace - In this episode we will talk about “brain rot” as not only the concept, but additionally the problem that it potentially could introduce alongside the multiple different perspectives on this issue.

## Introduction to ethical issue (have 2 references from course content + 2 references from out of class content)

- What are we talking about?
  - Transition, Grace: “So, first.. What exactly are we talking about? What is “brain rot” and where did this word even come from?”
    - Grace - History of word - both of grace’s sources (Boyle + Oxford University Press)
    - The history of this word is actually pretty interesting, but I am a self-proclaimed etymology nerd so maybe I’m a little bit biased. Within recent years, the word “brain rot” has seemed to grow in popularity - according to Oxford University Press (2024), it was named “Oxford Word of the Year” in 2024. So, this word seems to be more relevant now than ever.. It seems. Interestingly enough, this word has a bit more of a history than what we currently are experiencing or maybe even thinking about.
    - According to Oxford University Press (2024), the word “brain rot” was first notably used in Walden by Henry David Thoreau - written back in 1854.
    - When thinking about it, the word “brain rot” has really had the time to develop quite a bit over the years. 
    - Oxford University Press (2024) describes Thoereau’s usage of the word to relate to the inability to appreciate “complex ideas.” With this being said, we can definitely connect how he used the word into the way that it seems to most often be used today.
    - When considering a more recent definition, Oxford University Press (2024) defines “brain rot” as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.”
    - When we connect Theoreau’s usage of the word and how it’s used today, it doesn’t seem to be too far off. 
    - Now, let’s take a brief look at the time between Henry David Thoereau’s introduction of this word and what “brain rot” looks like today, in 2025.
    - Boyle (2024) considers how “brain rot” has been seen over the past few years - first they noted that “brain rot” was happening with email, and then now with our smartphones.
    - I think Boyle’s perspective is interesting, as it shows us that “brain rot” can honestly be defined by anyone in different ways. In other words, it seems that what “brain rot” is to one, may be a little different than what “brain rot” is to others.
    - I say this because I personally wouldn’t have considered email to be brain rot - I use it every day in school and it seems vastly different than the “brain rot” memes a lot of us Gen Z probably go straight to thinking about.
    - This leads us to today, in 2025. We might think about “brain rot” in relation to memes and online content, so let’s start thinking about that a little closer.
  - Brain rot as a genre
    - Jeanie - Go through the Buzzfeed quiz here
    - “Brain rot as a term covers these as well as all other silly, dumb or time-wasting online content that does not fall into any specific category, such as the video of the dancing animated character my research participants showed me. For them, brain rot is a very clear type of content, but it also represents one of the distinct ways to engage with TikTok.” (Owens)
  - Brain rot as an affliction
    - "Kind of touching back on Thoreau's original definiton, there's this idea that brain rot is a thing you can catch, like a virus." 
      - "But I think the connotation has kind of shifted a little, like we blame the people with brain rot for having brain rot."
    - "I'm sure you all have things to add to this list, but there's a lot of negatives associated with brain rot. Typically all the quote unqoute symptoms are mental or cognitive."
      - "The big ones I see most often are that brain rot, Tik Tok, social media, etc are making young people have lower attention spans or become less intelligent or have poor professional slash communication skills"
      - [Group Chimes-In with Others, end on something transitionable to Attention Span]
    - "I think the whole attention span thing is really fascinating. Previous generations called kids without focus 'stupid' or 'lazy', but now we use this crazy acronym 'ADHD'"
      - "Something I see a ton in the media is this idea that attention spans are getting shorter. But after having taken some cognitive psychology classes and learned about human perception through programming, a lot of articles are super misleading"
    - Effect on youth
    - Lowered attention spans

Brain rot as a generational descriptor? [Can cut]
 ‘The Brain Rot Generation’
Jeanie - ‘Banning Kids From Social Media Isn’t the Way - it’s the Over 60’s who Need to Get Off the Internet’ (Omar)

What are the different perspectives on this issue?
Transition, Grace: “So, we’ve outlined what exactly “brain rot” is and what the research is saying. Now, we’re going to discuss what different generations seem to think regarding “brain rot.”
What media, older generations say - Shyla– the media and older gens say that kids are online too much and have access to too much information compared to when they were younger, they believe that this mass access to media has caused significant issues in the way Gen Z functions and interacts with society.
What current generations say – Shyla – The younger generations are aware of the negative implications of overuse of social media and online content however they often choose to ignore it and just stay online.


Why should people care about this issue?
Grace - “So, now that we’ve outline what exactly brain rot is, its origins, what it seems to be doing, and the different perspectives on it as a whole, we are going to further discuss why exactly people should care about “brain rot.”
Grace - Impacts on attention span (Boyle)
In order to engage with “brain rot,” one has to engage with technology. For quite some time, we’ve seen studies regarding what technology, but specifically our screens and the internet are doing to our brains and bodies. 
Boyle (2024) discusses the studies and how numerous have pointed out that the internet is doing a few different things, one main thing involving shortened attention spans.
I personally see this, as well. I used to be more active with social media than I am now - and I feel like my attention span used to actually be worse whenever I engaged much more with this technology. 
We have some statistics on this, as well. Boyle (2024) summarizes the results of a study conducted by Dr. Gloria Mark - Boyle (2024) says that from this study, it was concluded that in 2004, the average attention span when engaging with any screen-based technology was 2.5 minutes, but dropped to 75 seconds in 2012, and then down to 47 seconds just 6 years ago.
I don’t know about you all, but this feels very alarming to me. The inability to focus for even just a minute when looking at a screen feels like something we should care about, right? As college students, we are looking at screens all day for our classes, since so much is virtually-based now, whether that be homework, parts of a class, or entire classes. 
We are still engaging with technology in a way that requires focus. This goes beyond just college - this happens in the workplace too. We have to find a way to avoid this alarming 47 second attention span that Boyle (2024) informed us of. 
Boyle (2024) points out that the thing actually is, social media itself is designed in a way that they are actually wanting us to completely lock in to whatever new trend or post is on our feeds.
Boyle (2024)  describes the “infinite scroll” as a part of online feeds that sort of tricks our brains into scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling, creating an addiction to constantly consuming more and more posts and online content.
I think we’re all at least a little familiar with this idea - people I know, myself included, tend to associate this with the term “doom-scrolling,” which basically just means that you’re stuck in a loop of scrolling for a long time on your feed, constantly engaging with new posts and content.
A brief glimpse into what we’ll be discussing in the next podcast
Jeanie - With increasing concerns of the impacts of brain rot, one naturally starts to question what they can do to combat it. Tune in next time to hear our proposed solutions to the “skibidi ohio rizz among us sus baby gronk” problem.
