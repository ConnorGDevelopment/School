Clear, J. (2018). Atomic habits: tiny changes, remarkable results : an easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones. Avery, an imprint of Penguin Random House.

Atomic Habits is a unique self-help book that explores the science of habit formation and changing but in a layman-esque way. The author experienced an injury that ended their baseball career and significantly damage their mental health and began working with therapists and psychologists to recover. Their goal in writing the book was more or less to make behavior science more accessible and usable by the average person. The primary points relevant to our podcast are that behaviors are not deletable, they are only replaceable; there is always some element they originate as a result of. Additionally, 'sheer willpower' is low on the totem pole of mechanism to change, with obstruction being near the top of the list.

## Solution 6: Ask yourself, is the problem actually brainrot?

So one way to deal with brainrot is to ask yourself "Is this a symptom or an illness?". It is very easy to point at media and declare that it is the problem, it is much harder to say "This area of my life is a problem" or "I am the problem". Jason Clear talks about this in their book Atomic Habits, but behaviors aren't a thing you can just delete, they're the result of something.

Using doomscrolling as an example: 

Some people do it because that's their normal environment, they need that noise or visual to feel comfortable at home.
And some do it because they work boring and unfulfilling jobs, so they're desperate for entertainment.
While others do it because they feel like not knowing a trend would be a social death sentence.

There is no blanket solution that 'fixes' the doomscrolling in each of those scenarios. You could throw your phone in the river, but then you'll either go straight back to it when you get a new phone or you'll find something to replace it.

There isn't anything inherently wrong with using technology a lot or consuming a lot of media, unless it is colliding with some aspect of your health. If you're in the position that you desperately need to do something about your media or technology consumption and that everything else in your life is perfect, then you just don't know what the problem is.

## Solution 7: Go learn

This is kind of an obvious remedy, but if you feel like

tying into the idea I mentioned of 'behaviors being deletable'.
