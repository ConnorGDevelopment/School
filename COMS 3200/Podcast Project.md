# Podcast Project

## Annotated Bibliography
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY: This assignment should help you choose sources that you are going to use in
your podcasts and help you start to draw connections between these readings and podcast conversation points.
• List of sources you plan to use in the podcasts (both from class and outside of class).
• You should include at least 8 total references in this document (4 from the course and 4 that you
find/choose. These can be news stories or podcasts, book chapters or journal articles).
• For each source:
o Include the full citation for each source in APA format. Our syllabus has the sources listed this way
for you to copy and paste.
o Write a paragraph summarizing each source (What does it say? Summarize key idea/points)
o Explain it’s relevance to your topic (i.e., How is this source going to help you? How might you use it
in your podcast? What kind of talking points might this give you?)

This is one of the earliest studies on attention spans and the origination points for a six to eight second attention span. The experimenters gave participants three consonants to remember and then had them count backwards from a given number in intervals of three. The study showed that around 30% of the participants forgot the three consonants after six to eight seconds and 90% of participants forgetting after twenty-five seconds. An important note about the experiment is that it was constructed to prevent participants from using common memory techniques to retain items in memory.

A commonly listed side-effect of brainrot is a shortened attention span. And very frequently, a modern study will be compared against an older study to make a point about a generation possesing a lower attention span than another generation. But what gets left out is that newer studies have the benefit of 50+ years of scientific advancement and tools, and even more than that the newer study will have an entirely different experimental design. These types of studies were conducted before the HD-EEG and modern brain imaging tools and before the notion of short-term memory having types.

### Sherry Turkle: Connected but Alone

APA: Turkle, S. (2012, February). Connected, but alone?. Ted Conferences. https://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_connected_but_alone?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare

The speaker of this talk is a sociologist with expertise in human online behaviors. The presentation centered on the change in viewpoint between their seminal work, which they were featured on the cover of TIME magazine for, and the present. Whereas previously, they were a strong advocate of the internet being a means for people to connect and communicate. They now feel as though the internet is causing a degrade in our communications. They present the idea that an intimate / in-depth / quality conversation is like a full drink of human interaction and that communication via technology is a fractional amount of that quantity, a sip.

As part of our podcast, we plan on discussing the impact / perceived impact of brainrot. A commonly referenced feature or symptom of brainrot being 'meaningless communication' or the adjustment to 'meaningless communication'. Turkle's talk provides an affirmation that there A) is a quantity of human interaction that is needed to feel fulfilled and B) that different communication channels can provide varying amounts of that quantity. In our discussion we can touch on if brainrot is the dystopian future that Turkle spoke about or if brainrot is just the newest form of media with little meaning a la slapstick, the Three Stooges, Charlie Chaplin, etc.
