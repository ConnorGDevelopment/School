## How would you describe the visual mood of the video game clip?

I think its a little ominous and kind of exciting.

## List two visual decisions you made to create that mood

1. I dimmed the lighting and angle it towards the piece so the shadows would cast into the track.
2. I setup the Cinemachine Dolly camera to follow the ball.

## Summary of the work you did and the time it took you

The biggest time consumer was the Cinemachine Camera, I wanted to make sure I learned something from this assignment since I've covered a lot of basics. Making the path was pretty easy but figuring out how to make the camera follow the ball correctly without wobbling everywhere because its rotating took me an hour or so.
