# Guarino Week 10 - Homework

![Unity Course SS](<What is Unity + What can Unity do..JPG>)

Game Link: Attached as Zip, WebGL for some reason won't run on my PC

Mod 1: I updated the controls to use PlayerInput. This just made it easier to map.
Mod 2: I made the Bird find its own RigidBody. This prevents silly inspector errors.
Mod 3: I had to fix the Pipe Spawn script and UI to use Unity 2022 version items.
