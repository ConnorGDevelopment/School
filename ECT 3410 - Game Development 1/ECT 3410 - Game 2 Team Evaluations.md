| Rev         | C      | I was actively engaged in the project and assisted in a lot of the development, but my individual portion was not finished in time to be pulled into the overall project. I could have asked for help or communicated this much better to avoid that outcome.                           |
| Eric        | A      | Eric was the spearhead for the planning and in-game development, they performed well above all expectations. At no point did their coding ability every serve as a limitation, within the first few weeks of the project they began matching me in terms of code quality and structure. |
| Britney     | E      | Britney helped with the presentation but we never got usable items produced for the UI or game itself.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Nick        | D      | Nick produced the models for the enemies and we were happy with them. But most of the progress was a blackbox and we knew they were stuck on getting the model to where it could be used in Unity but unsure as to how to help because of a lack of communication.                      |
