# ECT 3410 - Production Report

By Rev Guarino

## Accomplishments

The work I did was split between assisting on the in-game code and developing the Rogue System. Eric was the primary driver on the in-game code but was still relatively new to development. I assisted him a lot on the holsters and weapon mechanics, specifically with the use of Unity Events and how to make code that calls out / responds to events as opposed to directly tying every script together.

I'm concerned about getting my work in a state to where it is easily usable by the rest of team. The original state was very convoluded. I also haven't really displayed an interaction pattern for using a stat from the Rogue System to replace a static variable.

## Team Status

I am concerned about our team. I have no idea what Britney and Nick are working on. Eric is serving as the team lead, but we both have a lion's share of the project in front of us. I think we'll finish in time but I have no idea what we'll end up with in terms of new visual elements.

## Personal Goals

I want to get the Rogue System integrated into the holsters and the weapons, and soon. It is important that it gets woven into the current code that way we can develop the future code leveraging it. I also want to improve the reload mechanic so it doesn't need to track left vs right hand.
