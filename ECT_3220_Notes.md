### Control vs Agency

"Crew creates Control"

"Audience provides Agency"

"In every medium, the crew controls the story during its creation."
"In cine-VR, the audience has agency while the story is being experienced."

**Agency Types**

- Directorial Agency
  - Where you look
- Emotional Agency
  - Who you connect with
  - How those connections make viewer feel
  - When those feelings should occur
- Intellectual Agency
  - What you pay attention

**Control Types**

- Directorial Control
  - Forcing where the audience looks
- Emotional Control
  - Guiding audienc connections
- Intellectual Control
  - Insisting audience focus on details in a specific order or at a specific moment

Cine-VR provides "directorial agency" by allowing viewer to look where they want

### Emotional Agency vs Emotional Control

Primary Emotions Cervantes leads us to understand what Don Quixote is feeling by 
describing his perception of monsters (fear).   
 
Secondary Emotions Our own feelings are also based upon information that Cervantes 
has provided; namely that Don Quixote is not fighting monsters 
– he’s tilting at windmills (perhaps we feel a sense of unease?). ****
