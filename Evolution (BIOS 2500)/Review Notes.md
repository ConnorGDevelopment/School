## Lecture One: What is Evolution?

### Important Definitions

Definition of Evolution: Generally, descent with modification.

Definition of Theory: A hypothesis that has been confirmed by observation and/or experiments that accounts for all known information.

Fact: A validated piece of information.

Hypothesis: An testable and investigatable explanation.

Scientific Theory: The sum of of all information derived from observation, evidence, and experiments regarding a topic. **Not a hypothesis**

### Macro vs Micro

Macroevolution: "Meta" changes to life as a whole. Ex: Mass Extinction Events and Adaptive Radiation.

    "Evolution above the species level. Focus on large phenotypic changes or relatively long periods of time."

Microevolution: "Normal" evolution, changes to a specie or species. Ex. Natural Selection, Gene Flow, Mutation, Genetic Drift

    "Evolution below the species level, or among closely related species. Focus on the processes that cause evolutionary change over relatively short periods of time."

### Macroevolution: Whale Hips

Whales are both fish-like and mammal-like, how?

Linnaeus originally classified them as fish, later as mammals.

Darwin thought evolution was a gradual process, so there must be intermediate forms.

    *Loosely*, this is the Fundamental Theory of Calculus: Given a point A and B connected by continuous line, there must exist a point C between them.

Darwin hypothesized whales must have a land-dwelling ancestor. In 1979: Gingerich discovers *Pakicetus inachus* ie. Terrestrial Whale. Ambulocetus natans ("walking whale for swimming") are whale ancestors that had functional hind limbs (whales do not have functional hind limbs) that were probably for paddling.

Transitional Form: A species that exhibits traits shared by ancestral and derived groups, especially when the groups are sharply differentiated.

Evolution *tinkers* with existing structures to make new structures. Genes for limbs still exist in whales, but have been turned off, a concept known as **pseudogenes**.

Whale Baleen is an example of Macroevolution, it is a structure derived from mammal teeth.

### Microevolution: HIV

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infects immune system cells in humans.

Viruses are difficult to treat because they utilize the host's cells.

An early treatment was AZT, which interferes with a protein called "reverse transcriptase", which turns RNA into DNA. No longer used.

HIV does not copy itself perfectly, 50% of HIV DNA has a mutation. Some mutations cause AZT resistance.

Within the host and in the presence of AZT, mutants that are resistant to AZT survive and reproduce. --> Natural Selection at work

More Examples: Covid-19, herbicide resistance in plants, pesitcide resistance in insects, male birds with brighter plumage for mating, birds with duller plumage being eaten less than birds with brighter plumage, fish that humans eat becoming smaller and laying smaller eggs.

Small populations undergo random genetic changes faster than large populations.

## Lecture Two: History of Evolutionary Thought

### Classical School of Thought

#### Typological Thinking

The thinker believes there is a 'true optimal form'. The idea that species are 'real' and organisms conform to them.

    "The thinker believes there is some limited number of stable 'types' or 'forms', which explain the observed patterns of diversity in the biological world. For the typologist, type is real and the variation an illusion."

Emphasized final static perfection in organisms.

Great Chain of Being: scale from inanimate material, through plants, lower animals and human to angels and other spiritual beings.

### Materialist School of Thought

#### Population Thinking

The thinker sees species as a statistical representation of groups of organisms.

    "Stresses the uniqueness of everything in the organic world. All organisms have unique features and can be described collectively only in statistical terms. These entities form populations of which we can determine a mean and statistical variation. For a population, the type (average) is an abstraction and only the variation is real."

Material change of the physical world
First ideas about the process of evolution

### Greek: Classical School

#### Plato (428 - 348 BC): Ideal Form / Essentialism

Believed in an ideal or perfect form. Thought everything had a core essence, that could be discovered. Variation is meaningless, only essence.

#### Aristotle (384 - 322 BC): Scala Naturae

First person to develop a classification of animals. Classification based on Scala Naturae (natural ladder / chain of being). Simple to complex, movement towards perfection.

### Middle Ages (500 - 1500 AD): Classical School

Heavy emphasis on the chain of being.

Theories founded in the bible.

Intelligent Creation

All things created at once, no extinction.

Age of Earth: 6000 years old

Decline of Scientific Inquiry began before rise of Christianity.

Church did not encourage inquiry into nature, sometimes opposed it.

### 18th Century Natural Theology

Natural Theology: Gaining knowledge of God through nature / Natural Science that fits the Bible

    "In the 18th and 19th Century we see the rise of Natural Theology, the field of gaining knowledge of God drawn from nature."

#### Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778): Systema Naturae

Developed classification scheme for organisms

Fixivity of species

#### William Paley (1743 - 1805): Watchmaker

If you're walking around a path, see a watch, you pick it up and look at it. If you look inside, you'd see the intricacy and that the removal of any one piece would destroy the movement.

Argued that we have to an intelligent designer, because of the complexity of ecosystems.

### Natural Theology: Formalism (Structuralist)

Life is defined by biologic constraints imposed by the fundamental properties of matter.

The amount of ways an organism can be built are limited to a few designs (archetypes) including homologies like  (five digit limb) and basic body plans of major phyla (fish, bird, reptile, mammal, etc.)

#### St. Hilaire: Archetypes and Homology

Basic physical constraints arising out of the fundamental properties of matter

Archetypes: repeated design in multiple areas

Homology: similar structures in similar organisms because they developed from the same root

### Natural Theology: Functionalism

Contrasted formalism by stating that main designs of life (pentadactyl limb, body plans, etc.) are the result of succesive adaptations to perform specific functions in response to external demands of the environment, as opposed to physical or natural laws.

Organisms are like Machines idea

#### George Cuvier: Vertebrate Paleontology and Extinction

Father of vertebrate paleontology, created the comparative method of organismal biology

Did not believe in organic evolution because it would 'break' the animal

Established the fact of extinction, said there were 'revolutions' that caused the loss of organisms.

Tried to argue within the context of theology, didn't explicitly identify biblical / historical events, thought the Earth was old but was stable and similar to the present.

### Age of the Earth

The age of the Earth was a hot topic and many were trying to resolve information that contrasted the Bible

#### Young Earth View - 6000 Years Old

Bishop James Usher promoted a strict biblical interpretation with Earth starting on October 24th, 4004 BC

### Greeks: Materialist School

#### Thales of Miletus (624 - 547 BC): Natural Laws

Among the first to try to explain natural phenomena with science rather than supernatural

#### Anaximander (610 - 546 BC): From Mud

First theory of development of life
Arose from undifferentiated, universal substance
Humans from fish, plants from mud

#### Xenophanes (576 - 490 BC): Fossils were Alive

Among the first to state that fossils were previously living things
Earth came from mud + water and will reabsorb, the end of each cycle leaves fossils
"Ideas can be off, but that's where history starts" - Prof

### 18th Century Materialists

#### Comte de Buffon (1707 - 1788): Historie Naturelle, Buffon's Law, Common Ancestry, Superposition

Created Historie Naturelle, encyclopedia about the natural world

**Buffon's Law**: Distant regions with similar environments have different species therefore species must 'improve' or 'degenerate' according to their specific environment

Common Ancestry of Organisms -> Included Humans and Apes

Believed in organic change but didn't know the mechanism

Superposition: Sedimentary rocks are different ages, rocks above must be younger and below must be older

#### James Hutton (1726 - 1797): Uniformitarianism

Thought that the same natural processes are responsible for past and present events

Founder of Modern Geology -> Erosion, Sedimentation, Uplift

#### Charles Lyell (1797 - 1875): Principles of Geology

Popularized Uniformitarianism
Detailed natural geological processes

#### Erasmus Darwin (1731 - 1802): Zoonomia

Zoonomia, first formal evolutionary theory, single common ancestor

"would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament"

The Temple of Nature, limerick about evolution

#### Lamarck (1744 - 1829): First Attempt at Mechanism for Evolution

First Law: Use or Disuse

Second Law: Heritable Changes

View of Evolution - Increasing complexity and perfection was not due to chance
First to come up with a mechanism of how animals adapt
Did not believe in extinction, that species changed into other species

### The Stage before Darwin

The earth is very old
Extinction
Fossils were similar to extant forms

### Charles Darwin

Born February 12th, 1809

Voyage of HMS Beagle: 1831 - 1836

Second-born, no inheritance waiting for him
Had to get a job, father said he would be a doctor
Hated medicine, liked biology
Was a dropout
Father said become a Vicar, sent him to study theology
Met Reverend Henslow, a botanist, natural theologian, encouraged Darwin's interest in nature
Reverend Henslow recommended Darwin be the naturalist for the Beagle, ship of FitzRoy

Transmutation of Species
Notebook B
First phylogenetic tree diagram
Organisms being closely or distantly related

Malthus Notebook D
No checks -> population grows explanation
Formation of the idea of Natural Selection

On the Origin of Species
Alfred Russell Wallace sent Darwin a manuscript detailing Natural Selection, idea was going to scoop idea out from under him
Decided to present jointly with Wallace at the Linnaean Society
Organisms are the products of a history of descent with modification from common ancestors
Principle mechanism of evolution is the natural selection of heritable evolutions
Many Victorians rejected Darwin's work (humans come from apes, even though Darwin didn't say humans)
Scientists quickly accepted the fact of evolution
Natural selection as mechanism was not accepted until the 1930s (coincided with Mendel's study of genetics)

### Lecture Three: Tree Thinking

### Gradual Change vs Speciation

Darwin saw in the tree diagram an evolutionary justification for the Linnaean Hierarchy -> Common Descent

Classification has the potential to portray the historical relatedness of species, sort of...

Cladogenesis: The branching of one lineage into two lineages

Anagenesis: Evolutionary change between ancestors and descendants

### Reading a Tree

Tips: Taxon, groups of organisms are at the tips of the tree

Branching Point: Node, most recent common ancestor

Branch: Internode, representing an interating series of organisms within the same species

Monophyletic Group = Clades -> All the descendants of a common ancestor (1 cut)

Polytomy is a node or branch on a phylogeny with more than two descendant lineages emerging

Paraphyletic Group -> Includes some, but not all of the descendants of a common ancestor (2 cuts)

Polyphyletic Group: A group that is not monophyletic and includes a common ancestor that is placed in a different higher taxon. This is always a mistake and the features used to define such groups are usually convergently evolved.

## Lecture 8: Your Inner Reptile

Human embryos have a small yolk sac and tails. The yolk sac isn't filled with yolk though. Amniote is fluid-filled sac that cushions the embryo.

How to stop eggs from drying out? Amphibians return to water to lay eggs, Reptiles have amniote surrounded with hard shell.

Reptiles and Birds have yolk genes. Humans share some of these genes, but they no longer function, causing us to have yolkless yolk sacs. Evidence we came from egg layers.

Our skin shows our connection to reptiles. Reptiles have layered dead skin cells (scales) to stop them from drying out. Humans have thinner layers of skin with oil glands to protect the surface and preserve moisture.

Mammal-like reptile fossils show big changes occuring in their mouths and teeth. Teeth in many ways describe the full animal they came from.

Gorgonopsids are mammal-like reptiles with specialized teeth, a departure from the simple teeth of reptiles. Crocodiles have sharp peg-like teeth for biting and pulling. Gorgonopsids have different sized teeth including canines for piercing and incisors for cutting. Gorgonopsids had long legs with upright back legs and spread front legs, midway between mammal and reptile structure.

Cusps are ridges on teeth that are optimized for chewing. Specialized teeth saves energy via using the right tool for the job. Cusps are precursors to molars.

Reptile teeth are simple and can be easily replaced. Humans have more complex teeth that are difficult to replace. Human teeth have enamel for hardness and roots to secure them in place.

Karoo had large rivers that supported large animals and plants. Then 252 mya, widespread climate change killed most species, called the Great Dying or the End-Permian Extinction.

Some animals survived the Great Dying / End-Permian Extinction by burrowing underground and avoiding high surface temperatures.

Hair's origins may have started with whiskers, a sensory organ for navigating underground and in low-light conditions.

Eventually hair started to develop as a way to preserve heat.

Skin organs are used to make teeth, claws, scales as well. Teeth start as flat sheets and slowly become more bud shaped as the skin cells fold over and form layers.

The differentiation of skin cells is controlled by the EDA gene. We don't inherit structures from our ancestors, we inherit processes and instructions.

Ear flaps are unique to mammals. Mammals have much more sensitive hearing than reptiles.

All mammals share three bones in their ear: the Malleus, the Incus, and the Stapes. These form a lever system and in conjunction with the ear drum, let us detect vibrations in the air, greatly improving our hearing.

The early stages of development in mammal skulls are very similar to reptiles. We start with a one bone ear (Stapes), but as our skulls develop the Malleus and Incus separate from the mandible and join the ear.

Mammal jaws joints have changed significantly over time, with remants of our old jaw joint structures being integrated into our ears.

Hadrocodium is an important common ancestor to all mammals. They were special because they had ear bones (formerly jaw bones) that were slightly attached to the jaw still, showing the transition between reptiles jaw joints to mammal jaw joints.

Hadrocodium also had a big brain, the ratio of brain to body was 50% greater than contemporaries. This is because the multitude of sensory organs required more processing power.

### Review Questions

1. What is the amnion and what is its significance to the transition from water to completely living on land?

    > The amnion is the fluid-filled sac that surrounds a developing embryo. It is a significant evolutionary milestone because by preventing the egg from drying out, it eliminated a major need to return to water.

2. What is the evidence that we evolved from an egg laying ancestor?

    > A key marker that we evolved from an egg-laying ancestor is the presence of our empty yolk sacs during gestation. Our yolk sacs are produced by a fractured set of genes that are found complete in reptiles and birds.

3. How is reptile skin different from amphibians, but similar to humans?

    > Reptiles are covered in scales formed of dead skin that protects them from their environment and preserve moisture. This contrasts amphibians that protect their skin via a layer of mucus and is similar to oil covered layers of dead skin found in humans.

4. How does human skin differ from reptile skin?

    > Compared to reptiles, human skin has far fewer layers of dead skin in addition to oil glands that keep the outermost layer moisturized which removes the need for shedding.

5. Gorgonopsids were mammal-like reptiles that lived some 250 million years ago. Describe how their dentition separates them from reptiles, but makes them more similar to mammals.

    > A key feature that is present in Gorgonopsids, that is lacking in reptiles, is the presence of specialized teeth. Reptiles typically have simple and uniform teeth that are easily replaced whereas mammals feature jaws with a variety of complex and non-replaceable teeth.

6. What was the name of the mass extinction that occured 252 million years ago, wiping out most of life including the Gorgonpsids?

    > The Great Dying or the End-Permian Extinction.

7. In what types of environment is hair thought to have evolved? What was the function of the first hair?

    > The first hairs were thought to have developed in the form of whiskers in burrowing survivors of the Great Dying. They served as a new sensory organ meant to help underground and low-light navigation.

8. Hair, teeth, scales, feathers, and nails are all dervied from skin. These so called skin organs are the result of folding skin tissue. What is the role of the EDA gene with respect to these skin organs?

    > The EDA gene is the gene responsible for the differentiation and construction of skin organs.

9. Name three small bones that are found in our ears, what are their functions?

    > The Malleus, Stapes, and Incus form a lever-system that in conjunction with the ear drum, allow us to hear subtle changes in air vibration.

10. Unlike mammals, reptiles only have one ear bone. What did the incus and malleus found in mammals evolve from?

    > The Incus and Malleus evolved from the bone remnants left by the transition from reptilian jaws to mammalian jaws.

11. Hadrocodium is believed to be the oldest known mammal. It has a brain that is 50% bigger than any animal that came before it. Explain why Hadrocodium evolved such a large brain.

    > Hadrocodium had a large brain because it needed the processing power to host its variety of advanced sensory organs, notably whiskers and mammalian ears.

## Lecture 9 + 10: Biogeography

**Biogeography**: The study of the distributions of populations, species, and higher taxa, including the causes and consequences of species distributions.

    Biogeography, in layman's terms, is the study of "How did that get there?" and "What does it do there?".

Biogeography was started by Darwin + Wallace, though Wallace is considered to have played a larger role.

Darwin thought several biogeographic facts were strange, but made sense if species:
  
  Started in one region -> Gave rise to descendent species -> Achieved a broader distribution by dispersal

> Types of Distribution
>
> **Endemic**: Species that are limited to a specific area. Ex. Yonahlossee Salamander
>
> **Cosmopolitan**: Species found on all continents of Earth. Ex. Rock Dove
>
> **Disjunct**: A species with a gap in their distribution range.

Wallace defined six zoogeographical regions, based on the distribution of birds and mammals: Nearctic, Palearctic, Ethiopian, Oriental, Australian, Neotropical.

**Wallace's Line**: Very different groups of animals between Australia to Lombok and Bali to mainland Asia

## Lecture 11: Natural Selection

**Artificial Selection**: Selection via non-natural causes. Ex. Darwin's Pigeons, Dog Breeding, Produce

**Natural Selection**: A difference, on average, between the survival and reproduction of individuals with certain phenotypes compared to individuals with other phenotypes. ***NOT Surival of the Fittest***

    Include in Definition: Surviving to Reproduce, Phenotypes vs Phenotypes

Defining Natural Selection is difficult because it's a force like the invisible hand as opposed to gravity.

Only 65% of variation is genetically based, rest is environmental.

Mutation is random, not prompted, organisms don't mutate in response to their environment.

Mutation is when errors occur in DNA replication.

### Requirements for Natural Selection:

1. Individuals vary in phenotype
2. Some of the phenotypic variation is heritable
3. The trait impacts the organism's chance to survive and then reproduce (pass the phenotype)

**Struggle for Existence:** No species optimally and maximally reproduces. Ex. No woman starts having children as soon as possible and has a child every 9 months.

English Moths became darker in response to smog and became lighter again when the smog was cleared.

### Important Details on Natural Selection:

1. Only traits that impact probability of survival and reproduction are selected
2. Individuals phenotypes are selected which over generations can cause evolution
3. Selection can operate on non-heritable traits, it just doesn't cause evolution
4. Natural Selection is testable

**Teleology**: Explaining something based on it's end state rather than beginning state, ie. Evolution 'gave' wolves sharp fangs to hunt.

Natural Selection doesn't predict the future or plan ahead, **NO TELEOLOGY**.

Each generation is the result of natural selection on the previous generation.

    A generation can be unsuited for survival because the environment they live in is different than what the previous generation adapted to. Natural Selection doesn't know if there will or won't be a drought.

Natural Selection is non-random, but not necessarily progressive. There is a random chance component with a large amount of changing factors. Evolution also doesn't inherently raise complexity.

**Natural Selection does not lead to perfection.** Biomechanically, finches with deep narrow beaks can crack shells better, but they instead developed deep wide beaks to crack shells.

An adaptation must evolve by increasing the reproductive success of its possessor.

Genes that make you breed quicker will be favored, even if they have downsides like a shorter lifespan.

**Evolution can only tinker with existing parts.** It can only step left and right of the current design, it can't make something entirely new.

Homologous (From Shared Ancestry) vs Convergent (From Similar Context)

## Lecture 12: Adaptation

A trait that increases the ability of an individual to survive or reproduce compared with individuals without the trait.

A process of genetic change of a population, owing to natural selection, whereby the average state of a character becomes improved with reference to a specific function, or whereby a population is thought to have become better suited to some feature of its environment.

Don't confuse with Acclimatization in physiology.

Adaptations are the products of Natural Selection, the tangible result.

## Lecture 13: How Not To Be Eaten

### Camouflage

Coloration *and behavior* that helps an individual blend in with its surrroundings *or not be correctly recognized*. Allows prey to avoid predators and predators to ambush prey.

Kinds of Camouflage:

- Background Matching (Crypsis)
- Disruptive Coloration (Crypsis)
- Masquerade
- Batesian Mimicry

**Crypsis**: Avoiding Detection

#### Disruptive Coloration

A form of camouflage that works by breaking up the body outline of an animal using a strongly contrasting pattern.

Result: You see color patches, but lose the organism.

    Disruptive Coloration makes it hard to visually recognize something or misleads where it's features are (Oh no, that's the head not the tail)

- Makes boundares difficult to detect (differential blending)
- Create false boundaries (constructive relief)

#### Masquerade

The resemblance of an organism to a uninteresting inedible object. Hiding in plain sight, not just blending in to backgroud.

#### Aposematic Coloration

Colors or color patterns that act as a warning to potential predators that a prey sepecies is unpalatable, toxic, or dangerous.

#### Mimicry

Adaptive resemblance in signals between two or more species due to convergent evolution.

Two Kinds:

**Batesian Mimicry**: When a palatable mimic evovles similarity to an unpalatable, toxic, or dangerous model. The mimic is parsistic on the model.

    Batesian Mimics look dangerous, but are not dangerous.

**Mullerian Mimicry**: When two or more unpalatable, toxic, or dangerous species
evolve similarity in communication signals, due to the advantages of sharing
signals (e.g., shared predator education). This is a form of mutualism.

    Mullerian Mimics look dangerous, are dangerous.

### Evasion

How do animals escape predators once found?

## Lecture 14: Life History Evolution

**Life History**: An individual's pattern of allocation of time and energy to fundamental activities such as growth, body repair, metabolism, and reproduction.

**Lifetime Reproductive Success**: The number of offspring produced by an individual in their lifetime.

**Trade-offs**: Inescapable Compromises between traits that limit their evolution.

Some species mature early and reproduce quickly. Some mature late reproduce slowly.

Blue-footed boobies skip mating seasons to cultivate brighter feet (brighter preferred by females).

**Senescence**: Late-life decline in fertility and probability of survival.

Aging reduces fitness and should be opposed by Natural Selection.

Evolution doesn't inherently promote longevity because most animals don't die of old age.

**Pleiotropic**: Alleles that influence more that one trait.

**Antagonistic**: Alleles that confer both a benefit and a cost has pleiotropic effects that are antagonistic.

## Lecture 15: Sexual Selection I

### Red Queen Hypothesis

"Here, you see, it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place." - Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland

The idea that organisms will race to evolve against each other, which can result in some strange adaptations as they try to get a leg up on one another.

## Lecture 16: Sexual Selection II

When sexual selection is strong for one sex, and weak for the other we predict that:

- Members of the strongly selected sex will compete for mates
- Members of the weakly selected sex will be choosy, because mate quality > need to reproduce

### Female Choice

Explanations for choosiness:

- Good Genes
- Direct Benefits
- Sensory Bias
- Chase-away Sexual Selection

## Lecture 17: Evolution of Altruism

**Cooperation / Mutualism**: Actor and Recipient Benefit

**Selfishness**: Actor Benefits and Recipient Harmed

**Spite**: Actor and Recipient Harmed

**Altrusim**: Actor and Recipient Benefit

### Fitness

**Direct Fitness**: Personal Reproduction

**Indirect Fitness**: The additional reproduction by relatives that is made possible by an individual's actions

    Indirect Fitness is like the number of children born in your village

**Inclusive Fitness**: Direct Fitness + Indirect Fitness

**Kin Selection**: Natural Selection favoring the spread of alleles that increase indirect fitness

### Inclusive Fitness and Hamilton's Rule

Inclusive fitness is mediated by 3 factors:

**r = relatedness**

**B = the benefit to the recipient**

**C = the cost to the actor**

**Hamilton's Rule**: Br > C

Hamilton showed that a gene causing altruistic behavior can spread because the gene is not typically unique to them. When multiple organisms have an altruistic gene and act on it, the gene survives via that population surviving.

Black-tailed Prairie Dogs are an example of altruistic behaviors. When a badger approaches, they make a call that alerts others but also draws attention to themselves. Both males and females do this more often when they have kin nearby. They do this equally for parents and siblings as they do offspring, showing it is not just parental care.

### Reciprocal Altruism

Individuals can be selected to dispense altruistic acts if equally valuable favors are late returned by the benefactors.

    I'll scratch your back if (and only if) you'll scratch mine.

Two Conditions must be met:

- Cost to actor must be less than the benefit to the recipient
- Cheaters must be punished

Reciprocal Altruism most likely to evolve when

- Stable groups & individuals repeatedly interact
- Many opportunities for altruism
- Individuals have good memories
- Potential altruists interact in symmetrical situations

Vampire bats die if they don't eat for 3 days. If an individual doesn't eat one night, they can beg for another bat to regurgitate blood. They are more likely to do this for kin, but it is not required. They are also more likely to do this for individuals that have done the same for them previously.

## Lecture 18: Species, What Are They?

### Linnaean Taxonomy

Naming Species: Genus + Species

**Genus**: Made up of a closely related group of species
**Species**: Made up of individuals that regularly breed together or have characteristics that are distinct from those of other species

Linnaeus' system has issues defining certain organisms which has led to different species 'species' concepts that have been proposed.

Four main types of species 'concepts' have been proposed:

- Morphological
- Biological
- Phylogenetic
- Evolutionary

### Morphological Species Concept

A group of individuals that are morphologically distinct from other groups

    They're different if they look different

**Advantages**:

- Works on fossils
- Doesn't require geographic overlap
- Easy to identify species

**Disadvantages**:

- Geographic Variation
  - Salamanders of the same species may have different regional appearances
- Cryptic Species
  - Some salamanders are morphologically similar but genetically different
- Polymorphism within populations
  - Organisms of the same species and population, that exhibit different appearances

### Biological Species Concept

Mayr (1940): "Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups"

Dobzhansky (1937): "Species are the largest and most inclusive reproductive community of sexual and cross-fertilizing indviduals that share a common gene pool"

**Advantages**:

- Can distinguish between morphologically similar species
- Applicable to many ecological studies
- Clear and easy to everyone

**Disadvantages**:

- Doesn't apply to asexual species
- Doesn't work with fossils
- Hybridization is common
  - At least 25% of plant species & 10% of animal species can create hybrids (viable offspring with parents of two different species)
- Inconsistent reproductive interactions
  - Ring Species
    - Some populations of Warblers around the Himalayas are able to breed with different combinations of adjacent populations
    - A can mate with B, B can mate with C, A cannot mate with C, A and C still exchange genetics through B
- Requires geographic overlap
  - Allopatry
    - A population or species that is physically isolated from other similar groups by an extrinsic barrier to dispersal
    - Populations with non-overlapping geographic ranges

### Phylogenetic Species Concept

Defines species as the smallest clade that is diagnosable

**Monophyletic Group**: An ancestral population plus all its descendants

Monophyletic Groups are identified by traits called synapomorphies. A trait that is found in certain groups of organisms, but no in others. It is a homolgous trait (inherited from a common ancestor).

Synapomorphies can be behavioral, morphological, DNA sequences

**Phylogenetic Species**: The smallest monophyletic group on a tree, isolated from gene flow with other groups

**Advantages**:

- Works on cryptic species
- Takes advantage of advances in DNA sequences and phylogeny reconstruction
- Works on fossils
- Works on asexual species
- Works on species that do not have geographic overlap

**Disadvantages**:

- What characteristics should be used for a phylogenetic analysis?
- What level of divergence?
- Produces many more species
- Many species difficult or impossible to tell apart

### Evolutionary Species Concept

"A single lineage of ancestral descendant populations of organisms which maintains its identity from other such lineages and which has its own evolutionary tendencies and historical fate" - Wiley, 1979, modified from Simpson, 1961

    Species are evolutionary lineages

**Advantages**:

- Applies to fossils, asexual species, and taxa that do not overlap
- Focuses on the concept of what a species is
- Readily incorporates phylogenetic approaches

**Disadvantages**:

- What criteria are appropriate for lineage diagnosis?
- If a rat swims out to an island, is it a species?
- What creates lineages?
- Not operational
- Many more species if species are linages
- Too vague

## Lecture 19: Speciation

Three geographic settings for species formation:

- Allopatric
- Parapatric
- Sympatric

### Allopatric Speciation

The evolution of distinct species when populations are geographically separated by an extrinsic barrier

**Allopatric Dispersal**: When a portion of a population migrates across an already existing geographical barrier

    Dispersal is when Range Expansion -> Speciation

    Example: Fruit Flies in Hawaii
      A founder came to the first island
      As new islands formed, members colonized them
      Repeat

**Allopatric Vicariance**: When a population is divided by a new geographical barrier

    A continent splits in half and divides a population, members on one side will develop differently than members on the other

### Parapatric Speciation

The evolution of separate species across an ecotone

**Ecotone**: A transition between two adjacent but different patches of landscape, such as a forest and grassland

In Parapatric Speciation, there is no specific extrinsic barrier to gene flow

Continous population but non-random mating

Individuals mate with their geographic neighbors rather than individuals in a further portion of the species' range

Occurs when selection pressures vary across a species' range

    Example: Sweet Vernal Grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum)
      Grass near mines has developed heavy metal tolerance, but can still mate with non-tolerant grass
      Have developed different flowering times
      Could be first step in cutting off the gene flow between the two groups

### Sympatric Speciation

The evolution of separate species within a shared geographic range

    Example: Apple Maggot Flies
      Flies that lay eggs in fruit, originally used Hawthorne trees but switched to Apple trees
      Eventually the flies that used apple trees diverged
      Natural Selection has overwhelmed gene flow

### Reproductive Isolating Mechanisms

**Reproductive Isolating Mechanisms**: Factors that cause individuals from different groups to either fail to mate, or fail to produce viable offspring

**Pre-zygotic Isolation**: Reproductive isolation between populations due to factors that prevent mating for the formation of a zygote (fertilized egg)

**Post-zygotic Isolation**: Mating may occur but the zygote does not develop properly or the offspring are not viable

#### Pre-zygotic Isolation

**Behavioral Isolation**: Individuals of different species do not recognize each other as potential mates

**Mechanical Isolation**: Copulation may be attempted but transfer of sperm does not take place

**Temporal Isolation**: Individuals do not mate because they are active at different times

**Ecological Isolation**: Individuals mate in their preferred habitat, and therefore do not meet indviduals of other species with different ecological preferences

    Example: Turdus merula (Blackbird) and Turdus torquatus (Ring Ouzel)
      The blackbirds mate in the woods and the ring ouzels mate in the moorlands, so they do not mate together

#### Post-zygotic Isolation

**Zygotic Mortality**: The egg is fertilized, but the zygote does not develop

**Hybrid Sterility**: Hybrid is viable, but the resulting adult is sterile

    Example: Mules

**Ecological Inviability**: Hybrids develop normally, but suffer low viablity because they lack an ecological niche or do not make choices that confer high fitness

    Example: Willow Warblers in Sweden (Phylloscopus trochilus and Phylloscopus acredula)
      Trochilus breeds in South Sweden and migrates to West Africa
      Acredula breeds in North Sweden and migrate to Southeast Africa
      Hybrids migrate between West and Southeast Africa and die in the Sahara

## Lecture 20: Human Evolution

### Relationship between Humans and Primates

Homologies:

- Forward Facing Eyes
- Feet
- Gripping Thumbs
- Coccyx

**Molecular Evidence**: Analyis of primate genomes show primates for a monophyletic clade that branched off from other mammal lineages. Humans share many genetic similarities with primates and are deeply nested within the primate clade.

### Relationships among Humans and Apes

Ape Characteristics:

- Large Brains
- No Tail
- Erect Posture

"Great Ape" (Hominidae) Traits:

- Enlarged Ovaries
- Enlarged Mammary Glands
- Flattened Fingernails
- 32 Teeth
- Prolonged Parental Care

Unclear exactly where we branch from, but we are very closely related to Gorillas and Chimpanzees/Bonobos

### Recent Ancestry

The last common ancestor of chimps and humans existed ~7 mya

Likely Traits of Common Ancestor:

- Broad, fruit-based diet
- Use of tools
- Hunting
- Culture
- Knucklewalking (Gorillas knucklewalk, but orangutans fist-walk)

Common Ancestor may have had flexible cultural traits, RE: Chimpanzees vs Bonobos

Chimpanzees:

- Violent
- Male Dominated
- Males Form Alliances

Bonobos:

- More Peaceful
- Females Form Strong Alliances
- Lots of sex for all sorts of reasons

**Hominin**: Anything more closely related to humans than chimps

Hominin Innovations/Traits:

- Bipedalism
- Big Brains
- Tool Use

### Clues to Bipedalism

**Sahelanthropus**: Oldest Evidence of upright hominin. The spinal cord exits at the base of their skull (foramen magnum) whereas in chimps and apes it exits towards the back. This points to their head being above their body like modern humans.

**Orrorin tugenensis**: Found in Kenya, the orientation of the femur ball suggests an upright posture. The femur ball being at the top is likely an adaptation for bearing the weight of an upright upper body.

**Ramidus**: Had short fingers like modern humans and had a stiff foot (still had opposable big toe). This contrasts chimps which have long fingers and flexible feet.

### Australopithecines

Short, small-brained hominin that were bipedal but still retained adaptations for tree climbing. Does not refer to a monophyletic clade but to a "grade" of morphologically similar species.

Walked more efficiently than Ramidus because of double curve in spine, which lets upper body sit above hips. They also had straighter legs and knees beneath the midline of the body.

### Why did Bipedalism Evolve?

Towards the end of the Miocene temperatures started declining and droughts started in Africa.

One Theory is that upright posture allowed them to collect food from trees more efficiently (but no longer live in them). Additionally, with reduced tree density, being upright would allow them to walk longer distances efficiently.

**Peter Wheeler's Theory**: Bipedalism developed to reduce sun exposure which was very relevant in, now hot, equatorial Africa.

### Teeth and Tools

Compared to chimpanzees, Hominin teeth have:

- Smaller Incisors and Canines
- Bigger and Flatter Molars

Potential explanation: Shift in diet from fruit/leaves to nuts/seeds -> Need crushing teeth

Panthropus robusts and Paranthropus bosei had strong jaws and large skull ridge to anchor jaw muscles

What's more energy efficient than using big jaws? Using big brain!

Australopithecines stayed leaner and used tools to cut and pound food

**Homo habilis**: Meaning "handy man", early tool-using ancestor (not the first as originally thought)

## Lecture 24: Macroevolution

### Adaptive Radiation

**Adaptive Radiation**: The evolution of ecological and phenotypic diversity within a rapidly evolving lineage

Adaptive Radiation Criteria:

- Common Ancestry
  - Members of the radiation share a common ancestor
- Divergence of traits related to performance
  - Traits that differentially enhance performance in different environments
- Rapid Speciation
  - There is relatively rapid speciation into diverse niches

Causes of Adaptive Radiation

- Ecological Opportunity
  - Availability of unfilled niches via empty habitats
    - Geological Formation can cause new habitats to emerge
    - Extinction can empty existing habitats
- Key Innovations
  - A novel adaptation that opens up a new adaptive zone
    - Examples: Jointed limb in arhtropods and waxy cuticle in aquatic plants

### Punctuated Equilibrium

Patterns in the fossil record: species go unchanged for long periods of time (stasis) then new species appear suddenly

Darwin attributed this pattern to incompleteness of the fossil record

Eldredge and Gould argued that statis is a real pattern and that most morphological change occurs during speciation events

**Punctuated Equilibrium**: Rapid speciation associated with abrupt morphological change, followed by morphological stasis

    Stasis is data

Testing Punctuated Equilibrium requires:

- A phylogeny of the group
- A very complete series of fossils
- Ancestral species co-occuring with new species in the fossil record
  - Needed to prove it is not consequence of gradual change

**Bryozoa (Moss Animals)**: Phylum of aquatic invertebrates, they look like small corals

Cheetham wanted to disprove Gould and Punctuated Equilibrium so he went to study Bryozoas

Cheetham studied many, many fossils and found Bryozoas stayed the same for 2-6 my and then suddenly changed. This has become one of the greatest confirmations of Punctuated Equilibrium

## Coyne Chapter 1

Darwin's key innovation was natural selection

Evolution BY Natural Selection

### Six Parts of Evolution

Evolution, Gradualism, Speciation, Common Ancestry, Natural Selection, Nonselective Mechanisms

#### Evolution

Species undergo genetic change over time.

The changes are due to mutations in DNA and those mutations becoming commonplace because they aided in survival.

#### Gradualism

Evolution occurs across hundreds and thousands of *generations*

The speed of evolution is based on environmental pressures

#### Speciation

Speciation is when a species splits into two groups **that cannot interbreed**

Species don't have to split, they can keep iterating on themselves without branching

#### Common Ancestry

Vertebrates, organisms with backbones: Fish + Amphibians + Mammals + Reptiles

Amniotes, organisms with amniotic eggs: Reptiles + Mammals

#### Natural Selection

Darwin's Big Thing

Better genes means you survive better which means you have higher odds to breed

Mutations are changes to existing genes, not the genesis of new ones

**Only** process that can produce adaptation

#### Nonselective Mechanisms

Things other than natural selection can cause change, sometimes the randomness of life is the answer

Genetic Drift

## Coyne Chapter Two

Eukaryotes: Organisms with true cells (nuclei and chromosomes)

Eukaryotes -> Multi-cellular Organisms -> Tetrapods

Tetrapods: Four-legged animals, earliest of which were lobe-finned fish

### Tiktaalik

Tiktaalik was special because it had features found in both fish and amphibians

It was a missing link and novel transitional form

Fish:

- Gills
- Scales
- Fins

Amphibians (Salamander):

- Flattened Skull
- Eyes + Nostrils on top of the head
- Neck (as opposed to head-chest connection like fish)
- Sturdy Ribs which indicate the presence of lungs
- Sturdy limb bones in positions associated with terrestrial movement

### Theropods

Agile, carnivorous dinosaurs that walkled on two legs

Theorized to be common ancestor of birds and reptiles

Archaeopteryx is a transitional form within Theropods

Reptile:

- Jaw with teeth
- Long bony tail
- Claws
- Separate fingers on the wing (fused in modern birds)
- Neck attached to skull from behind (attached below in modern birds)

Bird:

- Large feathers
- Opposable big toe

## Coyne Chapter 4

### Notables

**Glossopteris**: Dominant trees from the Permian Period, conifers with leaves instead of needles. Expected to have lived in temperate areas with winters, but fossils are found throughout the southern hemisphere. Seeds not easily dispersed. Answer: Land Bridge

### Quiz Review

1. Define the term endemic.

    > A species that is isolated to a single geographic location.

2. How do we explain that groups of organisms that are completely unrelated, but look similar and fulfill similar roles, occur in different parts of the world. For example, the succulent cacti of north and south America and the succulent euphorbs of Asia, Australia and Africa?

    > Through convergent evolution, the development of similar traits in different species as a response to similar environments exerting similar selection pressure.

3. How do we explain why marsupials that originated in north America were able to colonize Australia? What evidence supports this hypothesis?

    > Via a landbridge connecting the two continents which has been validated by marsupial skeletons in Antarctica, which would have been the midpoint between the two.

4. Which groups of animals are often absent from oceanic  islands? Is it because they cannot survive on these islands?

    > FARM -> Fish, Amphibians, Reptiles, Mammals
    > No, in fact the opposite is true as evidenced by pigs and goats being incredibly invasive in Hawaii.

5. What do oceanic island species tend to have in common?  That is not present on those species that typically do no occupy oceanic islands?

    > Ability to colonize via long-range dispersal.

6. Where do the ancestral species of oceanic species typically come from?

    > They are typically species that can 'commute' from the island to the mainland.

7. How do we explain the observation that species found on a give group of oceanic islands (e.g. the Galapagos) tend to be closely related to each other?

    > Once a species colonizes an island, it will often speciate a number of times as populations begin to take advantage of the variety of competition-free ecological niches, resulting in physically adjacent species also being closely related.

## Coyne Chapter 5

**Genetic Drift**: The random change in the frequency of genes over time. It is evolution, but not from natural selection.

## Coyne Chapter 6

1. Traits that differ between males and females of a species are called [BLANK] [BLANK].

    > Sexual Dimorphisms

2. How does Coyne define sexual selection?

    > Sexual Selection is a subset of natural selection, that is based on the selection of traits that increase an organism's mating success rate.

3. What are the two forms of sexual selection?

    > Male vs Male Competition and Female Selection

4. Provide an example of post-mating competition in males.

    > Snake ejaculate forming a plug in the female's reproductive tract, guarding a mate, the penile scoop of a damselfly.

5. What is the cost to sexual reproduction?

    > You lose half your genetic contribution, which can be good or bad depending on your fitness

6. Explain why, in general, males are promiscuous and try to mate with as many females as possible, while females will be choosy about which males they mate with

    > Typically because females are the ones that have to raise the offspring, a job that is made easier when the child is genetically strong, while males expend the same amount of effort regardless of how genetically strong their child is.

7. Describe the direct and indirect benefits a female may gain from choosing a particular male.

    > Directly, a 'strong' mate can aid the female in raising the child. Indirectly, a fitter mate can yield a child with stronger genes.
