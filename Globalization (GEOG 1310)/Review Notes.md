## Globalization

### Core Definitions

**Globalization**: The increasing interconnectedness of people and places through converging economic, political, and cultural activities.

**Diversity**: The state of having different forms, types, practices or ideas, as well as the inclusion of distinct peoples, in a particular society.

**Physical Geography**: Examines climate, landforms, soils, vegetation, and hydrology.

**Human Geography**: Concentrates on the spatial analysis of economic, social, and cultural systems

**Thematic/Systematic Geography**: Geographical study oriented on a particular topic or 'theme' or 'system'.

**Regional Geography**: Geographical study oriented on a particular area.

**Cultural Landscape**: The tangible and material expression of human settlement, past and present.

**Formal Regions**: Areas that are defined by some aspect of physical form.

**Functional Region**: An area defined by the performance of an action or actions.

**World Regions**: Areas defined by the composite of physical features, language groups, and religious affiliations; in addition to trade groups and regional associations.

    ^: North America, Latin America, The Caribbean, The Russian Domain, Europe, Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa / Southwest Asia, Sub Saharan Africa, Australia and Oceania.

**Glocalization**: The process of modifying an introduced product or service to accomodate local tasts or cultural practices. The combination of the words globalization and locale.

### Components of the Global Economic Reorganization

1. Global communication systems that instantaneously link all regions and most people on the planet.
2. Transportation systems capable of moving goods quickly by air, sea, and land.
3. Transnational business strategies that have created global corporations more powerful than many sovereign nations.
4. New and more flexible forms of capital accumulation and international financial institutions that make 24-hour trading possible.
5. Global agreements that promote free trade among countries.
6. Market economies and private enterprises that have replaced state-controlled economies and services.
7. An abundance of global goods and services created to fulfill consumer demand - real or imaged.
8. Economic disparities between rich and poor regions and countries that drive people to migrate, both legally and illegaly, in search of a better life.
9. An army of international workers, managers, and executives who give this powerful economic force a human dimension.

### Arguments in Favor and Against

**Arguments In Favor**:

1. Enhancing competition.
2. Allowing capital to flow to poor areas.
3. Encourages the spread of beneficial new technologies and ideas.
4. Inefficent local industries become more efficient in order to compete with the new flood of imports.

**Economic Convergence**: The idea that poorer countries will gradually catch up with the more advanced economies.

**Arguments Against**:

1. Unnatural, the product of explicit economic policies by free trade advocates, capitalist countries, financial interests, international investors, and multinational firms.
2. Creating greater inequality between rich and poor economies.
3. Export-oriented economies are often exploitive of natural resources.
4. Homogenizes places, peoples, and environments.

**Middle Position**:

1. Unavoidable but still manageable.
2. Requires national organizations to reduce economic inequalities and preserve natural resources.

### Dimensions

**Relative Locations**: Referring to locations via adjacency to other locations. Ex. A is near B which is just beyond C.

**Absolute Locations**: Referring to locations via coordinates using a universally accepted frame of reference.

**Latitude**: AKA Parallels, Horizontal Rules on a Plane (Globe).

**Longitude**: Aka Meridians, Vertical Rules on a Plane (Globe).

**Prime Meridian**: The Vertical Midpoint of Earth, from which Longitudes are measured from.

**Equator**: The Horizontal Midpoint of Earth, from which Latitudes are measured from.

**Map Projections**: Methods of projecting the 3D spherical earth on a 2D plane.

**Choropleth Map**: A map in which shades represent different data values, with darker shades generally showing larger average values.

**Rate of Natural Increase (RNI)**: The annual growth rate for a country or region as a percentage.

**Total Fertility Rate (TFR)**: Average number of live births a woman has in her lifetime.

**Replacement Rate**: A TFR of 2.1, represents the number of births to 'replace' a set of 'traditional' parents, with a small amount added to account for infant and child mortality.

**Net Migration Rate**: The comparison between the amount of immigration (people entering a country) and emigration (people leaving a country).

**Culture**: A learned, not innate, behavior shared by a group of people, empowering them with what is commonly called a "way of life".

**Cultural Collision**: The interaction or exposure of one culture to another.

**Cultural Imperialism**: A type of Cultural Collision where one culture is promoted at the expense of another, ie. Colonialism.

**Cultural Nationalism**: A type of Cultural Collision, generally as a response to Cultural Imperialism, where a culture is promoted against an 'invading' culture in order to defend it.

**Cultural Syncretism / Hybridization**: A type of Cultural Collision where two cultures mix and adapt elements of each other's language, traditions, etc.

**Universalizing Religions**: Religions that attempt to appeal to all peoples, regardless of location or culture. Ex. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism. Generally, these religions seek converts.

**Ethnic Religions**: Religions that are closely tied to an ethnic, tribal, or national group. Ex. Judaism and Hinduism. Generally, these religions do not seek converts.

**Secularism**: The state of being non-religious or atheistic.

**Colonialism**: The formal establishment of rule over a foreign population.

**Decolonialization**: The process of a colony gaining/regaining control over its own territory and establishing a separate, independent government.

**Neocolonialism**: A term referring to the ways in which a country or countries indirectly or subtly exherts cultural, economic, or political pressure on a newly formed independent state.

### Population Problem Topics

- The current rate of population growth is now half the peak rate experienced in the early 1960s, when the world population was around 3 billion.

    At that time, talk of a “population bomb” and “population explosion” was common, as scholars and activists voiced concern about what might happen if such high growth rates continued.

    Still, even with today’s slower growth, demographers predict that over 2 billion more people will be added by 2050, with much of this growth taking place in the world’s poorest countries.

- Population planning takes many forms, from the fairly rigid twochild policy of China to slow population growth to the familyfriendly policies of no-growth countries that would like to increase their natural birth rates.

   Over half of the world’s married women use modern contraceptive methods, which has contributed to slower growth.

- Not all attention should be focused on natural growth because migration is increasingly a significant cause of growth in some countries.

   International migration is often driven by a desire for a better life in a new country.

    Although much international migration is to developed countries in Europe, North America, and Oceania, there are comparable flows of migrants moving between developing countries, such as flows from South Asia to Southwest Asia or immigration within Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

    In addition, the UN estimates that 60 million people were displaced as a result of civil strife, political persecution, and environmental disasters in 2015, the largest number every recorded.

    This includes both internally displaced people and refugees who have left their country of origin.

- The greatest migration in human history is going on now as millions of people move from rural to urban places. In 2009, a landmark was reached when demographers estimated that for the first time more than half the world’s population lived in towns and cities.

## Economy Fundamentals

### Factors of Production

**Land**: The territory and the capacity of that territory to provide resources to satisfy needs.

**Labor**: The efforts expended by individuals to bring a product or service to market.

**Capital**: The ability to purchase or acquire resources, land, and labor.

**Entrepreneurship**: The ideas and developments to transform a production system.

### Political Economies

**Economy**: The ways in which people use and interact with their environment to meet their needs.

**Political Economy**: Branch of social science that studies the relationships between individuals and society and between markets and the state, using a diverse set of tools and methods drawn largely from economics, political science, and sociology.

**Economics**: The study of the optimal use of scarce resources, has the assumption that the most optimal usage will be performed.

#### Capitalistic Economies

It is the economic geographic system that is characterized by the *private ownership* of the means of production and minimum governmental intervention. Often called market economy or laissez-faire capitalism.

**Market**: Firms (industries, companis, corporations) and households act in self-interest to determine how resources get allocated, what goods get produced, and who buys the goods.

    ^: Opposes how a command economy works, where the central government gets to keep the profits.

#### Command Economy

Almost opposite of market economy.

- A large part of the economic system is controlled by a centralize power (government).
- Government is often involved in everything from planning to redistributing resources.
- It is capable of creating a healthy supply of its resources, and it rewards its people with affordable prices.
- Government usually owns all the critical industries like utilities, aviation, and railroad.

#### Mixed Economic Systems

- A combination of different types of economic systems.
- It is a cross between a market economy and command economy.
- The market is more or less free of government ownership except for a few key areas like transportation or sensitive industries like defense and railroad.
- Government regulates private businesses
- "Best of Both Worlds"

#### Traditional Economy

- Tends to be rural, closely tied to the land.
- Each member of a traditional economy has a more specific and pronounced role.
- Societies tend to be very close-knit and socially satisfied.
- They may lack access to technology and advanced medicine due to lack of industrialization.

#### Economy Sectors

**Economic Sector**: A certain type of business activity within an economy.

- Primary: Production of Agricultural and Mining Materials
- Secondary: Industries that process products from the Primary Sector
- Tertiary: Provision of services, intangible products like education, restaurants, healthcare, information technology
- Quaternary: Management of Primary Sectors
- Quinary: Management of Multi-National or Large Corporations

## The Geographic Perspective

**Areal Differentiation**: Describing and explaining what distinguishes one piece of the world from another.

**Areal Integration**: The study of how different areas interact with one another.

### Economic Geography

Main Influences:

- Logical Positivism
- Location Theory
- Behavioral Geographies
- Phenomenological Geographers
- Structuralism Geography
- Radical Humanism

Most economic geography research is performed based on location theory and analysis.

Three most common questions:

- "What" products and services are produced
- "How" (what combination of resources) they are produced
- "Where" are they produced and "Why there?"

### Fundamental Concepts of Space and Location

### The Geographic Approach

#### Geography

#### The Geographic Inquiry

It is a mode of thinking similar to the scientific method, the main difference it involves the concepts of space and location.

Acquire Geographic Knowledge -> Find the data to answer your question

Good Q's:

- What's the geographic focus of your research?
- For what period of time do you need the data?
- For what subject(s) and specific topics do you need data?
- Why it is there?
- Does it describe a spatial pattern?
- Does it have spatial connections to other places or events?

#### Space vs. Place

##### Scale

##### Place, Regions

##### Nation, Country

#### The Geographic Political Context

#### Spatial Inequality

## Measuring Economic

Classifying countries based on their economic performance

### Why Do We Measure It?

Indicators allow us to examine local and global economic activity and allow you to:

- Measure size and structure of the economy
- Identify growth
- Describe contractions

### Understanding Wealth Measurements

### Good Comparisons, but...

Economic data are established by internationally agreed statistics. Ex: System of National Accounts, Balance of Payments, Government Finance Statistics, Monetary and Financial Statistics.

Although the standard have been agreed upon, their application at the national level varies.

### What Indicators Should We Use?

**Gross Domestic Product**: The value of all final goods and services produced within a region or country.

    ^: Refers to the total gross value added by all resident producers in the economy.

**Gross National Income (GNI)**: The combination of GDP and the net income from outside a country's borders through trade and other forms of investment.

    ^: The sum of total domestic and foreign value added claimed by residents divided by total population.

**Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**: The base unit for measuring GNI per capita, the value of goods that can be purchased with the equivalent of one international dollar in a particular country.

**Human Development Index (HDI)**: A composite metric based off of life expectancy, literacy, educational attainment, gender inequality, and income.

#### Other Indicators

##### Growth and Structure

Growth and Economic Structure: Agriculture Value Added, Industry Value Added, etc. -> Components of GDP

**SNA Approaches for Estimating the GDP**

- Production Approach
- Expenditure Approach
- Income Approach (no data in the World Bank's World Development Indicator database use the income approach)

In theory, all should give the same estimate.
