**Read Stevens 3+4 for next week**

**Type up notes from Intro to VR**

The environment doesn't need to be real, but the interactions have to be *realistic* per that world's 'rules'.

### Terms

Metaverse
: A space where users can interact with a computer generated environment and other users.

Immersion
: Objective degree to which a VR system and application projects stimuli onto the sensory receptors of users in a way that is:
    - extensive: range of sensory modalities for user
    - matching: congruence between sensory modalities
    - surrounding: extent to which cues are panoramic
    - vivid: quality of energy simulated (resolution, bit rate, frame rate, etc.)
    - interactive: user ability to change world/events, virtual entities responses to user
    - plot informing: "dealing with story, sequence of events in time, themes/messages" (Slater and Wilbur 1997, cited in Jeralds) --> events make sense within linear time

Presence
: The subjective degree to which a person feels 'in' a VR environment

Break-in-Presence
: Disruption of illusion of virtual world

Production
Making things/content -> What is content? -> Reciprocal bc content is what you make

Love to Money Continuum

Why do I want to be a Game Dev? -> Should probably come up with a concise answer

**Read Stevens 3+4 for this week**

Goals for these slides: Designing for 3D Experiences + Working in Unity

### Affordances and Multimodal Experiences in XR

XR lets you do experiences that you can't normally do.

Stevens says XR should inspire how you interact with the 'real' world. -> XR worlds should be realistic, but can be not real.

Stevens also says XR should be inspired by real world interactions.

XR experiences should engage in as many real world ways as possible.

### Primitives

3D geometric shapes that can be added, subtracted, and combined to make more complex shapes.

3D modeling is difficult at first but humans understand and perceive 3D better.

### Coordinates

Z is generally always depth, X and Y can get swapped

Things get weird in sounds design -> Z becomes height

### 3D Modeling Terms

Splines
: Called "paths" in Adobe AE
: 3D curves w/ two or more points

Extrusions
: Paths pushed into space, 2D -> 3D

Meshes
: Collections of points, edges, and faces that define an object

Polygons
: Multiple vertices and edges forming a complete geometric shape
: For modeling, polygons can be placed in 3D space

Materials
: Physical properties applied to a mesh that determine how light interacts with a surface

Textures
: Flat 2D images that form the 'skin' of a mesh

Camera
: The viewpoint of an entity in a scene

Good Design Tip -> Don't apply materials until lighting is set

Scene
: Combination of objects, environment, lighting, and camera.

Render
: Conversion of a 3D model to a 2D image that can be shown on a screen

In video, rendering is last step to make an output
In audio, rendering is the combination of the audio tracks into a single audio
