**Read Stevens 3+4 for next week**

**Type up notes from Intro to VR**

The environment doesn't need to be real, but the interactions have to be *realistic* per that world's 'rules'.

### Terms

Metaverse
: A space where users can interact with a computer generated environment and other users.

Immersion
: Objective degree to which a VR system and application projects stimuli onto the sensory receptors of users in a way that is:
    - extensive: range of sensory modalities for user
    - matching: congruence between sensory modalities
    - surrounding: extent to which cues are panoramic
    - vivid: quality of energy simulated (resolution, bit rate, frame rate, etc.)
    - interactive: user ability to change world/events, virtual entities responses to user
    - plot informing: "dealing with story, sequence of events in time, themes/messages" (Slater and Wilbur 1997, cited in Jeralds) --> events make sense within linear time

Presence
: The subjective degree to which a person feels 'in' a VR environment

Break-in-Presence
: Disruption of illusion of virtual world

Avatar Assignment due 1/30/24

Production
Making things/content -> What is content? -> Reciprocal bc content is what you make

Love to Money Continuum

Why do I want to be a Game Dev? -> Should probably come up with a concise answer

**Read Stevens 3+4 for this week**

Goals for these slides: Designing for 3D Experiences + Working in Unity

### Affordances and Multimodal Experiences in XR

XR lets you do experiences that you can't normally do.

Stevens says XR should inspire how you interact with the 'real' world. -> XR worlds should be realistic, but can be not real.

Stevens also says XR should be inspired by real world interactions.

XR experiences should engage in as many real world ways as possible.

### Primitives

3D geometric shapes that can be added, subtracted, and combined to make more complex shapes.

3D modeling is difficult at first but humans understand and perceive 3D better.

### Coordinates

Z is generally always depth, X and Y can get swapped

Things get weird in sounds design -> Z becomes height

### 3D Modeling Terms

Splines
: Called "paths" in Adobe AE
: 3D curves w/ two or more points

Extrusions
: Paths pushed into space, 2D -> 3D

Meshes
: Collections of points, edges, and faces that define an object

Polygons
: Multiple vertices and edges forming a complete geometric shape
: For modeling, polygons can be placed in 3D space

Materials
: Physical properties applied to a mesh that determine how light interacts with a surface

Textures
: Flat 2D images that form the 'skin' of a mesh

Camera
: The viewpoint of an entity in a scene

Good Design Tip -> Don't apply materials until lighting is set

Scene
: Combination of objects, environment, lighting, and camera.

Render
: Conversion of a 3D model to a 2D image that can be shown on a screen

In video, rendering is last step to make an output
In audio, rendering is the combination of the audio tracks into a single audio

## 1/30/24

Elon Musk starting up BCI, first chip implanted in a person

Gabe Newell from Valve also working or investing in BCI/similar

BCI & similar, read electrical signals from brain for input

Hawking had ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)

Hawking's interpreting device used eye tracking to send messages, Musk's device is supposed to operate faster than ocular input by just bypassing the medium

Feds investigated Musk's BCI after a monkey was killed playing Pong. Whistleblowers told news orgs and the company was invesigated, but FDA still cleared human trials post-investigation.

### 360 Video Issues, Possibilities, Considerations, and Gear Slides

360 Video lets a viewer control their perspective

Seems simple, but that is a significant change from normal film --> The creator fundamentally has less control over the experience the view has

Enhanced *and limited* by the fact it is capturing something in the real world or a real space

Ways to make 360 Video more interactive --> Branching choices / environment reacting to chosen perspective

### Big Q's for Course

- Am I using the technology in ways that explot its differences from other mediatic forms?
  - Common mistake with fisheye lenses / 360 camera is to put action in front of camera and not around, failing to utilize the technology
  - Past students made a funny kidnapping video that switched between static perspective (trapped in a chair) and dynamic perspective, you don't have to all-in with the new methods to fully utilize them
  - Hitchcock Mise En Scene - using perspective to isolate and emphasis events, ex: zoom in on hands when passing a pen
- Is my use of this tech engaging the potential that stems from immersion, presence, lack of fixed (or 2D), screens, etc?
  - Do we have a reason to explore or view more of the environment --> Don't make novelty where the value is ooh-ahh you can spin your head and see nothing

Real-World Content
"Content does not necessarily need to be created by artists. One way of creating VR environments is not to build content but to reuse what the real world already provides." - Jerald, p.246

### More Q's

1. What elements make up a good story?
2. How can a video or film use these elements to tell a story?
3. How can 360/VR technology enhance the capabilities of video storytelling?
   1. Idea: Horror Film using Mise En Scene, if you know where someone is looking, you know where the edge of their vision is
      1. Oh right, brain processes VR as real. Horror kind of problematic
   2. Further Idea: Diving helmet horror, 360 perspective but there is still an 'edge' to the viewer's perspective
4. What might be some technical or practical issues that arise from 360 video? Are they different from other VR/AR issues? How/why?
5. What types or genres of 360 video can you name (doc, training film, narrative, etc)? How can 360 video improve those specific genres?

### 360 Video

Standard film, television, and video limits viewers to a roughly rectangular frame.

Frames come from legacy of fine art (framed paintings + theater).

A framed image demans a rather limited spectatorial position and usually provides only a small viewing angle.

*[Sound-Image Analysis Paper](Sound-Image%20Analysis%20Paper.md) was assigned on Monday, due March 5th*

New AI - Sora, was impressive but also seemed like it was ripping Kangaroo Jack, puppy stock footage, and those old ships I had when I was kid.

Playtime - Jacques Tati
Artsy film guy with low to no dialogue movies feat bumbling old man

North by Northwest - Alfred Hitchcock
Score by Bernard Hermann, the 'godfather of music in film', he pioneered a lot of how sound is used in movies

Diagetic Sound - Sound that the characters can hear

### Q&A: Ambisonics vs Atmos, Stereo vs Binaural, Waves NX in Fairlight 

Link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2QON1y5BCo>

### 3 Diff Perspectives for Sound

1. Sounds is a pressure distribution that is only related to your position on the 'sweet spot'.
2. Sound from an emitter (speaker)
3. Sound as it enters your ears

1st Perspective -> Ambisonic, wave function on a sphere

2nd Perspective -> Traditional speaker/stereo setup

3rd Perspective -> Audio that is rendered exactly the way that a human would hear it (Binaural)

Monitoring and understanding is important because renders of sound in Ambisonics vs Binaural are so different

Waves NX is software that is good for modeling sound to head
