**Read Stevens 3+4 for next week**

**Type up notes from Intro to VR**

The environment doesn't need to be real, but the interactions have to be *realistic* per that world's 'rules'.

Metaverse
: A space where users can interact with a computer generated environment and other users.

Immersion
: Objective degree to which a VR system and application projects stimuli onto the sensory receptors of users in a way that is:
    - extensive: range of sensory modalities for user
    - matching: congruence between sensory modalities
    - surrounding: extent to which cues are panoramic
    - vivid: quality of energy simulated (resolution, bit rate, frame rate, etc.)
    - interactive: user ability to change world/events, virtual entities responses to user
    - plot informing: "dealing with story, sequence of events in time, themes/messages" (Slater and Wilbur 1997, cited in Jeralds) --> events make sense within linear time

Presence
: The subjective degree to which a person feels 'in' a VR environment

Break-in-Presence
: Disruption of illusion of virtual world
