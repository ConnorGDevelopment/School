## The Seventh Seal

It was kind of odd watching this film, I think the experience of the pandemic kind of helped me separate the Medievalism and how people would have acted. The scene that really made me take pause was the one in the tavern with all the villagers gossiping about the plague, each claiming it was divine punishment, the devil, the apocalypse, etc. I think pre-pandemic I would have fully written it off as villagers being uneducated and superstitious. That scene made me think about all the things people said or thought during the pandemic like "It was China trying to make a weapon" or "It's a hoax to keep us inside". I think as a species we're just a superstitious as the villagers in that tavern, the only change is that we now tell science-fictions where we once told fictions.

That was the big thing I got out of the film, I kind of had trouble following the plot. I didn't get why Antonious and his squire were just alone, like if they were returning from the crusades then where was everyone else? I thought the chess game with Death was intriguing but I didn't really understand when it was happening, like if it was when he was asleep or if he was having visions. I did enjoy watching Antonious' battle with faith in the face of perceived evil and that kind of internal conflict of "This terrible thing is happening but I am told God is good" felt very modern.

## Passion of Joan of Arc

I found this movie super unsettling. I learned that my Visual Snow Syndrome makes black and white movies difficult to watch because the extra layer of fuzziness on top of the film grain makes objects lose their borders. It was fine for the Seventh Seal because less things were on a white background, but it made the wide-eyed close-ups on Joan of Arc turn into Lady Cassandra from Doctor Who.

The film made me super curious about the actual role of the Catholic church during the Medieval ages. From the content of this course, I know they were not "Big Brother" and constantly hunting deviants. But a lot of movies portray them as a judicial body which doesn't make sense to me. Was court only held for matters relating to the Bible? If not, then who were the arbiters?

Something that really stuck with me from the movie was when the priests asked if Joan was implying that God hates the English. Because that makes sense, if Joan was sent by God to fight the English then reasonably God has a bone to pick with the English. What was even more confusing for me was that Joan was later sainted by the church.

## Devil's Historian Ch. 6

I thought this chapter was fascinating. The most poignant part of it for me was the exploration into the West's perception of ISIS. I think it was more present with Al-Qaeda than with ISIS, but there was this constructed image of terrorists being technologically inept and living in caves. I think the author erred though in attributing this wholely to latent racism. While that is certainly a major component of it, it skims over the fact that presenting terrorists like that gives people confidence and safety. Americans aren't scared of cavemen, gladiators, or knights invading our country. But we are scared of things like a foreign power pressing a button and ending the world or a group capable of disabling the power grid.

I also found the idea of extremism being unequal to literalism to be novel. Because that's the view were always given, extremists are people that follow a literal translation of their holy book and the non-extremists follow some adaptation; but in reality it is the opposite. It's especially mind-boggling because that perception is most-often placed on Muslims and Jews because both the Quran and the Torah explicitly include statements equivalent to "Do not piecemeal the passages of this document, passages must be read and followed in their entirety".

## Discussion Question

In reference to what I wrote about the Seventh Seal, what historical movie do you think the pandemic most changed your perspective of and why? Did living through the pandemic change your views on people living through the bubonic plague?
