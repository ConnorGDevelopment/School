## Darkon

Darkon tells the story of a grand conflict fought by a Baltimore LARP community. But more than that, it shares a dialogue about the paradoxical nature of fantasy roleplaying games. It shows how making up a fantastical persona and living in that imaginary role allowed people to not only be their more authentic selves, but enabled them to grow and become better versions of themselves. And despite Darkon being a mythical and imagined land, the community it created was incredibly real.

The movie takes turns shining a spotlight on the real and fantasized lives of different members. The first of which is Skip, known in Darkon as Bannor of Laconia, a stay-at-home father of a very full household. Whereas in real life, he is the heir to a fallen and forgotten wargaming empire, in Darkon he is a powerful figure in the nation of Laconia.

Then Kenyon, known in Darkon as Keldar of Mordom, is introduced. Kenyon, as described by his parents and sister, was a lonely and introverted child but through Darkon, was able to find his voice and his tribe. Kenyon cites a great deal of his personal growth as being a result of his character Keldar, and that by playing the person he wanted to be, he was increasingly able to become that person.

The third of the major characters introduced is Beckie, known in Darkon as Nemesis of Caldonia, a single mother and ex-stripper. In her real life she struggles a great deal with a lack of autonomy, a struggle she escapes by leading her small nation to war.

Across the varying members of Darkon, there are a lot of varying sentiments given for what Darkon means to them. For some like Gary, Darkon provides them with purpose to contrast jobs they feel have no meaning. For Andrew, Darkon is a medium to do be noble and good and escape the crushing weight of materialism and consumerism. For others, Darkon is a way to be eschew issues like low self-esteem and confidence.

The movie also discusses the stigma around roleplaying and how they are often viewed as childish. But a shared rebuttal from the members of Darkon is that the only difference between the role they play at work and the role they play at Darkon is that they actually want to be one of those roles.

The movie climaxes with a final conflict between the Alliance of Free Nations of Darkon and the Mordonian Co-prosperity Sphere. A battle aimed to break the oppression of Mordom on the realm, which ends in Bannor being slain in a duel with Keldar himself. And in a final dual monologue, Kenyon describes how Darkon prepared him for reality and Skip describes how Darkon allows him to escape reality, leaving a final emphasis on how fantasy can deliver us to and from reality.

## Dr. Chang Talks LARP

In this lecture, Dr. Chang initially talks about how we adopt the past era's interpretation of the Medieval era. We use a similar framing to create and uphold modern ideas surrounding societal norms, making a specific note about Chivalry and courtly love. The conversation also moves towards a dialogue about the most problematic points of Medievalism like the "Only Europe existed in the Middle Ages". For me, I thought Dr. Chang's point about 'regardless of setting, movies are about the present' was fascinating. And he goes into how a lot of movies create a setting that is not accurate to the time period but is accurate to the creator's perception or 'ideal' perception.

I also loved the back-and-forth about LARP because of its place in my life. He goes into a questioning line mentioning how character motivations should be of great concern. Making a prominent point about why it is somehow normalized to be inexplicably violent when taking on a persona and what makes that a desire. A notion that I now feel great shame in taking part of and consequentially drafted several notes for my psych.

## Humor and History

This lecture was crippling for me as it goes in depth about how I've been watching Monty Python wrong. The first point made being that the creator of Monty Python was incredibly knowledgeable about the Medieval period which I began to speculate during my viewing. The conversation then moves into talking about how the most historically accurate part of Monty Python is obviously not the events of the movie, but that it may be an excellent example of what a Medieval filmmaker would create. It also ends with an affirmation that despite the dreary portrayal we are given of the Middle Ages, humor is not a modern invention, it is a symptom of humanity that was as present then as it is now.

## The Devil's Historian

This chapter of the book took an interesting turn and talked about the positive aspects of Medievalism. I think Kaufman subtly asserts a very important point that Medievalism isn't bad, interpreting Medievalism as reality is. And he goes on to describe the Society for Creative Anachronism that embraces Medievalism as wholly fantasy and strives to put the positive ideas of Medievalism into the world. In addition, the SCA is also a means for different crafts to be revived which is unintentionally a profound way of preserving history. The author also discusses how video games and the recent motions to make them more inclusive by adding race and sexuality options, is promoting a more realistic Medievalism, one that accounts for and includes more of our past man. Before wrapping up on recent movies featuring Medievalism, it promotes the Historical Medieval European Arts which was the center-piece of my childhood. It then closes on how our modern storytelling, specifically in Marvel movies, is becoming richer and more colorful because of the way it adopts and challenges Medievalism.

## Terry Jones Obituary

This brief article describes how works like Monty Python weren't the result of a comedian trying to be historical, but of a historian stumbling into comedy. And it describes how Terry Jones allowed the natural human concept of laughter to pervade his work rather than forcibly shunt it out.

## Monty Python

This viewing of Monty Python was surprisingly more enjoyable and informative than I expected. Monty Python as a movie is constructed as a play on the the expected tropes of Medievalism. In many ways, it presents maybe the most accurate origin of some tales. For instance, the knights are asked for aid by King Arthur and upon their arrival find that he is a deranged semi-hermit writing letters requesting aid he does not need. In addition to the humour, it sheds a spotlight on how Medievalism inserts certain fables as if they are not just stories. Though ridiculous, this presentation of King Arthur is more plausible than "He was a real person declared King of England for retrieving the Sword in the Stone". I interpreted the Trojan Rabbit as also being a sort of honorable mention of how Medievalism inserts events and fables from different ages into the Medieval one. The Trojan Horse of course having been a story from a previous chapter of history, but quite sensically might as well join the witch trials as neither occurred during that time period. Overall, the movie is quite deep in the connections you can spot or potentially make up if you know your history.
